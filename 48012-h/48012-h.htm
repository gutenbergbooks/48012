writing proved good, and served hym as he served me, yet nothing but

<p>We had newes this day that our junk <i>Sea Adventur</i> is retorned the
second tyme into Xaxma, and that there grew some broyle theare betwixt
som Portingals bound out in a junck for Camboja and Mr. Eaton. The
reason grew because the Portingales picked occation because Mr. Eaton
passed by them without puting affe his hat (he being bound to doe no
more to them then they to hym); so that from wordes they fell to
blowes, but the Portingalles were well beaten and driven abord. Soe
after, they complayned to the justice that our junck had no <i>goshon</i>
nor passe from themperor of Japon, but went out on pilfering.
Whereupon the justice of Xaxma demanded of Mr. Eaton yf he had any
passe (or <i>goshon</i>) from themperour or noe. To which he answered he
had, and shewed it unto them, desyring them to tell hym wherefore they
asked such a question, the which they tould them was by reason of the
Portingalles information.
<!--023.png--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
&ldquo;Whie, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I pray yow demand
whether they have any passe or noe, for it may be they are theeves and
would put it upon others.&rdquo; Which being brought in question, they were
fownd to have no passe. Soe they cauced their junck to be brought on
shore, and 15 or 16 Japons to be laid handes on which went in her. And

Emperours pleasure, whether they should procead on voyag or noe.</p>

not meddell therein. Which is the occation I have now wrot this

Yet the man was fownd alive and soe brought into towne, I seeing hym

whores, and soe wounded hym selfe (but not deadly) to make the world
beleeve theeves had taken it from hym.</p>

the neighbours coming to speake in their behalves, affermyng all was
lies and that they would take such order that handes should be laid
upon such as were heard to sing it hereafter and punishment inflicted
upon the offenders. I imagen they were set on by the Hollanders, songs
haveing byn made against them to lyke effect before, but not against
us.</p>

handes of the Companies, to make
my private benefite thereof. Which being brought in question, he said
he thought the China Capt. owed me 1000 <i class="measure">taies</i> more then I had put to
acco. To which I replied, it had byn better he had told me therof then
to speake such matters to others; but that, to burthen me with keeping
money of the Companies I took in ill part, and for the China Capt. I
esteemed hym such a man as would deale well with me and hym both.</p>

<p><i class="day">Aprill 24.</i>&mdash;I brought the matter in question this day with the
China Capt. tuching the 1000 <i class="measure">taies</i> that Jno. Osterwick spoke of, noted by
me yisterday, and som wordes were about a parcell of money delivered,
namely of 2000 <i class="measure">taies</i>, at one tyme, which in the end the China Capt.
said he thought Niquan his kinsman had receved. I stand in dowbt of
1000 <i class="measure">taies</i> more, noted downe in my booke the 11th December, 1616,
but blotted out by my selfe this day to bring the rest to rightes. God
grant Jno. Osterwick deceave me not.</p>

<p>Capt. Speck sent a man with 3 peece China lynen, with complementall
wordes that they had non to sell, but sent them of his owne provition
he kept to make hym shertes. I retorned hym thankes per hym which
brought them, and bad hym tell Capt. Speck I would send hym money for
them, which I did sowne after. But he retorned the money and sent me
word he gave them as a present, wishing they were better.</p>

reported (or tould to hym) this day that he was out of purce 500
<i class="measure">taies</i>, he knew not how, which he had paid out, he knew not how, not
having written it downe.</p>

<p><i class="day">Aprill 25.</i>&mdash;I rec. a letter from Capt. Adames per way of Langasaque,
dated in Goto, le 28th of Marche last, in the rode (or haven) of
Narra, in which he wrot me of the extremety they passed in loosing of
their rudder.</p>

<p><!--037.png--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>

vizet his brother Whow, she never having byn there before, as also to
contract a marriadge betwixt her and the sonne of an other rich China
called Goquan.</p>

<p>Yt is now reported that the <i class="title">Tono</i> (or Kinge) of Firando will not goe
to Edo this yeare. Soe he hath geven leave to his hostes son of Osakay
to goe his way, whoe a long tyme hath staid to goe along with hym.</p>

<p><i class="day">Aprill 28.</i>&mdash;There was a silver spoone lost at supper, and non in the
howse but our owne folkes. So som of them went to a wisszard to know
whoe had taken it. He wished them to look presently out for it, and
they should come to knowledg whoe had it, but, yf they let midnight
passe, it would never be knowne. Wherupon they made a privie serche,
and went about to heate a ston red hott, and take it in their hands,
it being dailie proved that those which are giltlesse goe free and the
giltie burne. Whereupon Bycho (the boy I gave Mr. Osterwick) willed
them to desist, and he would tell them where the spoone was, but carid
them to divers places, they not finding it; and in the end tould them
he had cast it into the sea, willing them to let it alone and say
nothing, and he would bring it back or pay for it, etc.</p>

<p><i class="day">Aprill 29.</i>&mdash;I brought Bicho to disepline (or whiping cheare). Soe at
first he stoutly denied what he of hym selfe had formerly confessed;
but in the end he yilded, and said he had stolne it at supper tyme,
and delivered it to the servant of a Japon. Soe I sent to that mans
howse, but his servant was working at Hollandes howse, he sending for
hym and Bicho acknowledging he had receved it from his handes, we
being at supper, he being without, looking on a munkie or ape. But
that fello denid it, and his master used many thretning words, that he
would kill Bicho for sclandring of his servant. Yet the boy still
stood to his word that the said fello had it. Whereupon I sent Mr.
<!--038.png--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>
Osterwick, with our <i>jurebasso</i>, to Taccamon Dono, to seek justis
against that fello; but he was gon to the kinges howse before they
came.</p>

<p><i class="day">Aprill 30.</i>&mdash;I sent Mr. Osterwick to Taccamon Dono, cheefe
justice, to demand restetution of the silver spoone of the recever,
although he denid the recept thereof, otherwais to proceed against hym
by order of justice. He retorned answer, he would do me justice.</p>

<p><i class="day">May 1.</i>&mdash;Gonosco Dono envited us to dyner to morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Nealson and Mr. Osterwick went to Tabola with their women to make
merry; but Nealson entred into humours at his retorne, being in potum.</p>

<p><i class="day">May 2.</i>&mdash;I canot forget to note how Mr. Nealson roze this night,
three howers before day, and called me up to drink, etc., and fell
into termes with me because the neighbours went not out to meet hym
with a banket, laying the falt in me; and, not contented with that,
caused the porter to open the dore to let hym out, as though he went
to walk (as ordenarely he seemeth to doe). But I, wondering he went
out soe tymely, roze up to have geven hym councell to take heed how he
went out at such an hower, but fownd he was gon over the way to Mr.
Osterwickes lodging, to tell hym (in my hearing) that I used them as
slaves and not as merchantes, with stamping and swearing upon it, and
that it was not to be sufferd. I have much adoe with this man in his
drunken humours, he seeking (when he is most soberest) to set me at
odds with all men. God defend my just cause.</p>

<p>We were well entertayned at Gonosco Donos at dyner, and had much talk
about the Hollanders and English, being by hym urged thereunto, and,
as I think, set on by the King or <i class="title">Tono</i> of Firando. But, as it
should seeme, they esteemed much more of our nation then of the
Hollanders, esteeming them as theeves and we true men.</p>

<p><i class="day">May 3.</i>&mdash;There is some murmering speeches geven out
<!--039.png--><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>
that these
sotherne <i class="title">tonos</i> (or kinges) draw back whoe should set forward first
to goe up to themperour, and he of Umbra sent this of Firando word
that he might exskews the matter in respect of his infermity (or
sicknesse), and the rather because no other is about to goe as yet,
except it were Frushma Tay, whose cuntrey is neare Cyaw (or Miaco).
This Frushma Tay is as greate a man as he of Xaxma, and of more
revenews, and loved and esteemed at Miaco more then any other prince
in Japon; and he only is gon to Miaco, and no ferther; and what will
ensue is uncerten. Yet out of dowbt, yf Miaco, that is to say Cyaw,
Osakay, and Sackay waver from themperour, and that Xaxma, Frushma Tay,
and the rest of sotherne lordes take part against hym, he will hardly
preveale. For out of dowbt all the northerne lordes are not sure, no
not his owne nephewes, etc.</p>

<p><i class="day">May 4.</i>&mdash;A brute was geven out the <i class="title">Tono</i> (or King) of this place
Firando would set forward towardes themperours court, and all the
boates ready to accompany hym. But it proved but a falce allarom, as
divers other tymes hath byn the lyke; only to make a shew he is a
going, for out of dowbt themperour is not without spies in this and
all other places.</p>

<p><i class="day">May 5.</i>&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to Taccamon Dono, and Bicho the boy
with hym to certefye that he delivered the spoone to that other
felloe; but still Taccamon Dono puts me affe with the kinges going
out, yet that in the end he will doe me justice.</p>

<p>Before nowne the King of Firando went out on his voyage towardes
Miaco, or to themperours Court. The Hollanders shot affe 5 peeces
ordinance at their howse, as the boates passed by; but one recoyled
and strouck up earth and stoanes, and hurt a Hollander very sore which
gave fire. There were many barkes went out to accompany hym out of the
harbor, and amongst the rest both us
<!--040.png--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
and the Hollanders. I carid hym
2 pottell glasse bottelles of very good strong annis water, stilled by
my selfe heare, and the Hollanders carid a stick or peece of <i>ginco
callamback</i> (or lignum allois) which I think could not be a <i>li</i>. He
seemed to be merry, and drunk to us both, with many others.</p>

<p><i class="day">May 9.</i>&mdash;Taccamon Dono and rest of nobles retorned from accompanying
the king onward on his journey to Miaco; and soe I sent our
<i>jurebasso</i> againe to hym, to procead in justice about the stolne
silver spoone. He retorned answer that he was content I should
proceade to my owne content (or as I would), only their triall was by
fire, so that, yf he I burthened proved to have it, it was to my
honor, otherwais, yf I accused hym wrongfully, the contrary. Soe he
wished me to be well advised before I proceaded therein.</p>

<p><i class="day">May 10.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. retorned from Langasaque and brought word
how the junck wherin Capt. Adams went is retorned back to Langasaque
(as all the rest which went out are the lyke), and that our junck <i class="shipname">Sea
Adventure</i> is at Liqueas and lost her voyag for Syam. Also that the
juncke of Billang Ruis (which should have gon for Phillipinas and went
out a month before Capt. Adames) hath also lost her voyag and retorned
back, haveing in 3 stormes (or tuffons) cast most part of her lading
overboard, to lighten her.</p>

Liqueas, and hath lost his voyag or monson, yet, as it seemed, ment to
stay theare till begining next monson and then procead on her voyag.
But he advized Mr. Eaton his opinion to lade her with wheate and
retorne to Japon, which course I formerly advised hym to take yf he
lost his monson. God grant he take it.</p>

<p><i class="day">May 17.</i>&mdash;This day the King Firandos bark retorned from Miaco, which
carid up his horse, and they report that the Emperour hath sent downe
order to Miaco that all the <i class="title">tonos</i> of Japon shall stay theare, and

our shiping, as the Hollanders doe the lyke with an ould junck of
theires.</p>

<p>The China Capt. being sick of the headache extremly, I gave hym a glas
bottell roze vinegar I brought with me out of England.</p>

howse, envited his kindred and other neighbours Japons to heate his
howse (as they terme it), where they drunk themselves drunk for
company, with howling and singing after a strang manner, yet ordenary
in Japon.</p>

<p>I paid vii&#189; <i>mas</i> small plate to Matinga for covering or
shingling the howse.</p>

<p>I receved a letter from Mr. Nealson from bath at Ishew, dated 4 daies
past, wherin he writes to have Robt. Hawley, the chirurgion, to com to
hym to let hym blood and purg hym.</p>

selfe into the ould howse his father kept at Edo, and that his sonn (a
littell boy of 10 or 12 yeares ould) shall remeane in the cheefe

<i class="day">June 1.</i>&mdash;We had this day 6 ship carpenters and 13 laborers about
tyying our littell juncke to serve to caryn shiping.</p>

<p>Mr. Osterwick is falne sick on a sudden with much paine in head and
boanes.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 2.</i>&mdash;This day was 9 carpenters, 7 cawkers, and 18 laborers about

for carpenters.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 3.</i>&mdash;This day 10 carpenters, 7 cowkers, and 20 laborers for
junck.</p>

<p>Capt. Speck came to English howse to vizet me, and is much affeard of
the junck which went owt this yeare, in respect the others are retornd
and lost their voyage. He tould me he howrly expected shiping from the
Molucos.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 4.</i>&mdash;I rec. a letter from Jor. Durons, dated in Langasaque, le
12th of this month, new stile, wherin he wrot me how Feze Dono had
accused Twan Dono for murthering 17 or 18 Japons without law or
justice, and amongst rest a famely, because the parents would not
consent to let hym have their doughter, and the maid her selfe passed
the same way. But the councell tould Feze Dono they would have hym to
take in hand matters of leeveing and not dead people. Soe then he
apeached Twan and his children as Christians and maintayners of
Jesuistes and fryres whoe were enemies to the state, and hath cauced
18 or 20 to be taken. So that it is thought greate persecution will
ensue at Langasaque.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 5.</i>&mdash;Robt. Hawley went to Ishew to Mr. Nealson to geve hym
phisick and let hym blood, as he required. And I wrot Mr. Nealson a
letter, and sent hym a barell of skarbeare and 10 loves bread and a
barell Japon wyne for their provition.</p>

<p>We had news towardes night that there was 2 shipps without, and in the

<p><!--044.png--><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
<i class="day">June 6.</i>&mdash;Early in the mornyng the domene (or prist) of the Holland
shipp <i class="shipname">Son</i> came to vizet me, and tould me how our ship <i class="shipname">Adviz</i>
departed from them the second day after they went from hence, or
rather they sayled from her, and since they know not what is becom of
her. The domene tould me they sent the small ship <i class="shipname">Gallias</i> to
Cochinchina, where they had not staid 3 daies but there entred 6 China
junckes, all which they took and brought them away; and that it is not
a month past that this shipp took 4 China junckes more.</p>

<p>Soe I sent Ed. Sayer to Capt. Speck to use complement of their ships
safe retorne; and he exskewsed hym selfe he had not sent me word
thereof before. He tould Ed. Sayer how they had not medled with any
junck which was bound for Cochinchina, only they had taken 16 junckes
which were bound for the Manillas; and were on the cost of
Phillippinas, where they burned a Spanish ship, all the people being
gon ashore.</p>

<p>Also they say the <i class="shipname">Gallias</i> was in the rode of Amacau, where they rode
at an ancor serten daies, and the Chinas came abord of them with
provition and silk stocking and other matters, using them kyndly.</p>

<p>I went out to meete the Holland shipp <i>Sonn</i> at Cochy, and carid Capt.
Barkhowt 1 <i>barso</i> wyne, 1 of skarbeare, a hogg, and 5 hense; but
he was on the way, and entred the same tide into the harbor of Firando
without casting ancor. He used much speeches to me of his
proceadinges, and that he had taken Chinas twise, I meane them which
the <i class="shipname">Gallias</i> had taken before, and after tould me they were of them
they had taken at Manillas the yeare past. Once it is certen they have
taken 6 junckes which were bound from China to Cochinchina, and yet
deny it, saying now it is vj wickes since they saw the <i class="shipname">Gallias</i>, and
that they had put 40,000 <i class="measure">tais</i> plate into her to goe to Cochinchina
to trade, and what they have donne since they know not. So yt is easie
to be seene by the wordes the domene tould me all is falce.</p>

Mr. Nealson and Robt. Hawley retornd from Ishew.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 7.</i>&mdash;Yt is serten that the Hollanders have taken more riches
this yeare from the Chinas then they did the last, and each marrener
hath his cabben full of silk stuffes and musk.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 8.</i>&mdash;Towardes night the Duch shipp <i class="shipname">Gallias</i> arived at the rode
of Cochy in Firando. But, as they say, it is allmost a month past that
they left company of 3 junckes they brought in company with them, per
meanes of stormy wether, they haveng put 7 or 8 Hollanders into each
of them, which they now think the Chinas have cut throtes of and carid
the junckes away. They report the wether was soe extreme when they
took those junckes (and others) that they could not discharg the
goodes out of them, because the sea went soe hie, only brought them
along with them, expecting calme wether, but lost them, as afforsaid.
They say that, having taken most parte of goodes out of 1 junck, and
seeing her reddy to sink, they put 900 Chinas in to her, and bad them
shift for them selves, etc.</p>

<p>Capt. Adames did also retorne this day per land because the sea went
hie.</p>

<p>All these people begin to murmor against the Hollanders for taking all
junckes they meete, whether they trade into Japon or no, and doe all
under the name of English. Soe God knoweth what will com of it.</p>

<p>A quarter master of Duch ship <i class="shipname">Son</i> gave me 6 muskcods.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 9.</i>&mdash;The Hollanders were in councell to have sent back the ship
<i class="shipname">Gallias</i> to have looked out for the 3 juncks which they put their men
into. Yet in the end they were of an other mynd, in respect it is
above xx daies they lost sight of them, etc.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 10.</i>&mdash;The <i>Gallyasse</i> came into the harbor at Firando, and I
sent out our <i>foyfone</i> to helpe to tow her in.</p>

<p>Cornelius Scott, pilot of the <i class="shipname">Son</i>, gave me a littell gold ring with
a garnett ston set in it.</p>

<p><!--046.png--><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>
<i class="day">June 12.</i>&mdash;Many Chinas and Japons came from Langasaque to Firando
with R. of 8, to buy stuffes of Duch marreners, and wanted not store
of falce R. of 8. Jno. Yossen bought good store of stuffes of them for
reddy money at deare rates, as their damasks, grograns, and sattens
ordenaris, at 5 <i>tas</i> peec.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 14.</i>&mdash;I gave Mr. Nelsons woman the out side of a <i>keremon</i>,
silk, for that shee made me halfe a dozen shertes and would take no
payment.</p>

<p>The capt. of the <i>Gallyasse</i> sent me a <i>barrico</i> of Spanish wyne for a
present, and, after, Capt. Barkhout, accompanied with hym, came to
thenglish howse, where I entertayned them in the best sort I could.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 15.</i>&mdash;This day Capt. Speck sett at liberty 5 or 6 Chinas of the
princepall in the junck, and gave each of them a bar of plate. They
went and lodged at howse of Andrea Dittis, China Capt. Yt was held
base to geve them no more, being such men as they were, and is thought
that the Emperour will bring matters in question, because these ij
shipps went out of purpose to rob and for nothing else, making by this
meanes his cuntrey a receptacle of theeves, to his great dishonor and
their owne inriching. Yt is thought both Spaniardes, Portingales, and
Chinas will goe to Cort, and cry out with open mouth against them
tuching that matter, and the rather because themperour will not suffer
his owne vassalles of Japon to doe the lyke.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 16.</i>&mdash;They decked all the eves of their howses this mornyng with
flagges and mugwort, in honer of the great feast which is held to
morrow, being the 5th day of the 5th month.</p>

<p>All the Chinas which are sett at liberty out of the junck came this
day to thenglish howse to vizet me, and said they fownd per experience
the English nation were honorable people, and soe would report when
they retorned into their
<!--047.png--><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
cuntrey, and made no dowbt but we should
have entrance for trade. They complained much of the hard usage of the
Hollanders.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 17.</i>&mdash;I went and vizeted the Hollanders at their howse, whoe
used me very frendly, and shewed me all their new workes, which truly
is greate, in enlarging the mantion howse with a new hall, divers
fayre chambers for merchants, two new gedonges (or warehouses), with a
gatehowse and duffcote, a strong howse made of lyme and ston to put
gunpowder in, many lodgings for sick folkes and for other uses, beside
ston work for walles and wharfe, etc.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 18.</i>&mdash;I receaved a letter from Tozayemon Dono, our host of
Sackay, wherin he wrot that silck is risen to 320 <i>taies pico</i>,
per meanes that the junckes have lost their voyages this yeare.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 19.</i>&mdash;We sent a present to an ambassador of Xaxma that is now
com to towne, viz. 2 <i>tatta</i> fustion to make hym a vest, and 2
tablebooks.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 20.</i>&mdash;Jorge Durons writes me the Amacan shipp is safely arived
at home, as they are advized per a junck of Camboja which went
thither.</p>

<p>The ambassador of Xaxma came to thenglish howse and brought me a
present of a barell wyne and vj fyshes, offring to send me a letter
for Liqueas, or any other matter I would demand.</p>

<p>A mad gentellman (as it is said), having byn pocessed with the devill
more then a yeare past, was this day at a banket with his father,
brother, wife, and kyndred, they perswading hym to be better advized
and leave affe such cources. But on a sudden, before it could be
prevented, he start up and drue out a <i>cattan</i> and cut affe his
brothers head, wounded his father, allmost cutting affe his arme, and
cut his wife behind her sholder on her back, that her entrills
appeared, wounded divers others, and slue out right his steward (or
cheefe man). And yet it is thought nothing
<!--048.png--><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>
will be said to hym,
they which he hath kild being his kindred and servantes, he being a
gentelman.</p>

<p>Also news came to towne that theevs are on the way betwixt this and
Langasaque, 3 or 4 vessells, to robb such as com to buy merchandiz of
the Hollanders; and took on boate, killing 3 men and 3 women; which
others escaping made knowne to the justice of Firando, whoe sett out 4
or 5 vessells, armed with munition and solders, to seek them out; and
the Hollanders armed out a bark with small ordinance, to accompany
them in the action.</p>

<p>The China Capt. had letters this day per way of Xaxma out of a junk
arived theare (which should have com for Langasaque, and forced per
them of Xaxma to stay theare), that the letters I sent are receved by
the noble men in China in good parte, and a mandarin, or <i>loytea</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
apointed to com for Japon, to speake with the Chinas and me about the
matter, and withall to goe to themperour of Japon about the receving
the Hollanders into his domynions which robb the Chinas. Yt is above 4
months past that he was apointed, and now howrly expected.</p>

 Chinese: <i>lao-ye</i>, a title of respect.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 21.</i>&mdash;I wrot 3 letters to Mr. Eaton, willing hym, at sight
of any 1 of them, to retorne for Firando with the junck laden with
wheate, and not to procead forward from thence for Syam in begining of
wynter, it being dangerouse. These letters I sent per ambassador of
Xaxma, whoe departed from hence this mornyng.</p>

<p>This gentellman had iij <i>tattamis</i> yello broad cloth, xi <i>taies
tattam.</i>, and Icadono, the gentelman remayning heare, gave his bill
for payment thereof at demand.</p>

<p>I am enformed that Chinas and Japons have byn at Miaco before Ingo
Dono, Lord Cheefe Justice of Japon, to complaine of the theevery of
the Hollanders; and he asked them whether the English did not the
lyke, which they said no. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the Emperour will take
order for these matters shortly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!--049.png--><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>
<i class="day">June 22.</i>&mdash;There came news that shiping was entred into the rode of
Cochy and shott affe ordinance; and Albaro Munos sent his man to me to
tell me he heard 3 or 4 greate peeces shott affe. I know not wherefore
these people doe this but to mock at us, because we have no shipping
com in as Hollanders have, and urge us to send out boates and men to
look for nifells,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> that they might laugh at us the better
afterwardes. Truly, I think it is not without instigation of
Hollanders, who, although they speake us faire, love us not. Yet I
dowbt not before it be long to see them fall into the trap they
provide for others.</p>

 Trifles.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 23.</i>&mdash;The barkes that went out to look for the theevs retorned
without fynding any thing. Out of dowbt, they were advized from hence
of what was pretended against them, and soe prevented the danger. For
here is such a company of pedlers which goe up and downe the streete
crying wares, that the lyke I have not seene till now, and after such
a redickalus manner that it is to be noted. And amongst the rest, one
counterfetted the blind-man, and was fownd out, and then fell a
laughing, and was let goe without saying any thing to hym. I saw this
my selfe.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 24.</i>&mdash;There is flying news that they of Goto have taken ij
boates of the theevs; but I think it will prove a lie.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 25.</i>&mdash;I wrot ij letters, j to Capt. Whow in answer of his 2

 Kuwashi.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 26.</i>&mdash;The Hollanders sett all the rest of the Chinas att
libertie, and gave them their aparell and other luggadge. It is
thought som frend put them in mynd to doe it, understanding complaint
was made to themperour of their proceadinges,
<!--050.png--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
and that they did more
then the Japons them selves durst doe, not only to take the Chinas
goodes, but to keepe their bodies captives, making Japon the store
howse or receptacle for their theeverie, much to the dishonor of
themperour to suffer it. It is to be thought it are papistecall
Christians which doe it, for they put themperour and councell in mynd
that it was to be considered that these Hollanders, fyew years past,
were naturall vassals to the King of Spaine, and by open rebellion
cast hym affe. Soe that, yf themperour gave entrance to them, it would
geve discontent to the King of Spaine, whoe was helde to be the
powerfullest prince in Christendom; and besides, it might breed som
alteration in the hartes of his owne vassales to doe as the Hollanders
had donne with the Spaniardes, and it may be by provocation of the
Hollanders to make others as they them selves are, to the overthrow of
the state of Japon.</p>

<p>This was I secretly enformed of per a China, thinking I was an enemy
to the Hollanders. But my opinion is, yf the Hollanders be driven out
of Japon, thenglish must not stay behind; for the Spaniardes and
Portingales geve it out that thenglish were they which gave them
meanes to stand out against their naturall prince, and held their
cheefest fortresses in their power, and was to be thought (as som have
tould me) that they and we were all on in effect, allthough different
in our proceadinges.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 27.</i>&mdash;Towardes night news came that the junck of Yasimon Dono of
Langasaque (which went for Syam) is safely retorned to Langasaque, and
hath brought word that the Hollandes junck and an other of Langasaque
came out with hym, and were at sea altogether, and cannot want to be
on this cost.</p>

<p>And within night Capt. Adams sent me word that the small junck of Jno.
Yoosen which went from Cochinchina for Camboja the last yeare is now
arived in a harbor neare Languay in Crates.</p>

<p><!--051.png--><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>
<i class="day">June 28.</i>&mdash;Late towardes night the Hollandes junck from Syam arived
in the roade of Cochy, a league from the towne of Firando; and Jno.
Yossens at Tasquey, a league or ij on thother side Firando.</p>

<p><i class="day">June 29.</i>&mdash;About nowne the junck of Jno. Yoosen entred, which came
from Camboia. They report that one of thenglishmen of the ij is
theare, namely, Mr. Savidge (as they think), fell into a madd humour
and ment to have kild hym selfe with a pistoll charged with ij
bullettes, and shot hym selfe, but after was cured.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> The other
Englishman is called Facie. These men say that we have somthing com in
the other junck of Yosen, but they know not what it is, nether have
those Englishmen wrot i word by this junck. They say also that
thenglish have built a junck, and sent her for Pattania with such
merchandiz as they had bought in Camboja, and that the king of the
cuntrey is a greate frend to thenglish, but a mortall enemy to the
Portingalles and Spaniardes.</p>

<p>And I sent Mr. Sayer abord the junck of Jno. Yosen with a barill wyne
and 3 hense, to bid the master welcome and know whether we had any
letters com in them.</p>

<p>And Jubio Dono, servant to King of Crates, came to vizet me and
brought a barrill <i>morofack</i>; and an other gentelman of that place
came in company with hym, and he envited me and the rest of thenglish
to dynner ij daies hence.</p>

<p>And within night Capt. Speck sent me a packet of letters which came in
their junck from Syam. Wherin one Richard Pittes writes of the death
of Jno. Johnson that was in place before hym, and sent an other letter
which he receved from Mr. Adam Denton, dated in Meslapotama, the 20th
August,
<!--052.png--><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
1617, wherin he writes Mr. Gurney died betwixt Bantam and that
place, coming to have byn agent for the Cost; and that Generall
Josephe met with a Portingale carick bound from Portingall to Goa, and
fought with them ij daies about the Iland of Comora, beating her
mastes overboard; soe in the end they fired her them selves, and, as
it seemed, escaped ashore at Camora, Bengamyn Josephe hym selfe having
byn slayne at first with a peece of ordinance, and Capt. Pepwell
suckceaded in his place.</p>

<p>Also he adviseth that the King of Callecut detayneth all in his handes
that Capt. Keeling left theare, so that the <i class="shipname">Unicorne</i> going

<p>And that from Suratt we have setled a new factory in the kingdom of

<p>The Hollandes junck entred into port of Firando, and I sent out our

lading; soe, yf ours had gon, yt is thought she had had but a bad
voyag. I wish Mr. Eaton had followed my comition and laden her with
wheate, having lost their monson, and so might he have made (it may

my selfe, where we were

<p>A Hollander, a quarter master, gave me a peece black taffetie and vij
musk cods for a present. He tould me that Mr. Nealson had geven hym a
crosse staffe gratis, whether he would or no, he offering to have
geven hym either money or stuffes for it, but he would not take any
thing, but bad hym take it away with hym. But the Duch man desired hym
to let it ly in his chamber untill he had made a new chist to keepe
both it and other matters in.</p>

<p>But in the mean tyme Mr. Nealson sould it unto an other Hollander,
wherat this man took exceptions, having geven it hym before. Of the
which I tould Mr. Nealson aparte, in frendly sort; but he took pepper
in the nose, calling the Holland ill names, and misusing hym in vild
termes, although Ric. King, our butler, were <i>jurebasso</i> betwixt them
when he gave hym the staffe, he geving hym as bad wordes as the rest
only because he said it was marvell the Hollander would speake of such
a matter, yf he had not geven it hym. In fine he called the Hollander,
dogg, and thenglish as bad, in my hearing, telling me to my face I
sett them all one to misuse hym, espetially Ed. Sayer, my viz-regent,
when God is my judg I have byn taxed with all thenglish in the cuntrey
for suffering Mr. Nealson to abuze all men as he daylie doth. Thus
much I thought good to note downe, whether I live or dye, that truth
may be knowne. I gave hym back his dager this day, he telling me that
Cornelius the Duchman offred hym 80 <i>pezos</i>, or R. 8, for it and his
rapier; but he had not had it an hower by his syde but he fell into
this frenzy, madd, or at best drunken, humour, and in my hearing rapt
out an othe, by the blood of God, that let thenglish stand cleare of
hym, for, yf they used hym in such sort, he would speed som of them.</p>

<i class="day">July 3.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Alvaro Munos, dated in Langasaque,
10th July, new stile, wherin he writes that news is com from New
Spaine that Don Juan de Fashardo, sonne to Don Lues de Fachardo, is
ordayned governor of the Manillias, with 1000 soldiers and 300
mareners, in 3 gallions and 6 galles coming from New Spaine. Also,
that the fleet in Manillas, which fought with the Spaniardes the last
yeare, is all cast away per stormy wether, many Mores, Chinas, and 50
Spaniard being drowned in it; and that their is 8 new gallions built
theare in place thereof. For the 8 gallions, I esteem it a lie, that
on such a sudden they canot be made. Also, that the Frenche have sett
out 8 gallions, or men of warr, to aide the Spaniardes in their
affares. And that the King of Spaine had ordayned a fleete of gallions
to have com by Cape Bona Speranza, to have joyned with them at
Manillas, to have gon for the Molucas; but had staid them to make
warrs against the Duke of Savoy.</p>

<p>Miguell, the <i>jurebasso</i>, reared his howse this day, and I sent hym ij
<i class="measure">taies</i> in small plate, and a barill wyne, the plate on my owne acco.
Also Mr. Nealson, Sayer, and Osterwick sent each of them a <i>tay</i>, all
for Capt. Adams sake, whose servant he was in tyme past.</p>

<p>So, Matias, the Hollander capt. of junk which came from Syam, came to
vizet me this day. He tells me that Mr. Pittes the Englishman envited
one James Peterson, thenglish umper, to a banket at Syam, and after,
upon what occation he knew not, fell out with hym, and went with iij
Japons to bynd hym and take hym prisoner. But Peterson laid soe about
hym that he kild ij of the Japons, and made Pittes and the other to
run away. This Peterson is in greate favour with the King of Syam, and
therefor I marvell Mr. Pittes would take this cours; but Mr. Mattias
saieth it was doone in drink.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 4.</i>&mdash;We had news that Jno. Yoosens other junck
<!--055.png--><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>
which came from
Camboja is entred into Langasaque, in which I esteem we have letters
and somthing else; but no letter came in the other. Our nation is over
slo in writing; the labour is not greate.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 5.</i>&mdash;News came from Langasaque that a frigatt or ij are entred
theare which came from Amacau, and that 4 or 5 more are a coming
after, and that they bring store of silk and peeces of silk, for that
the carik will com no more. They report that these frigattes (or
galliasses) met with a Hollander or English shipp at sea, and sunck
her; but out of douwbt that is a lyie, only they may have wronged our
junck <i class="shipname">Sea Adventure</i>; but if it com to knowledg they may pay deare
for it, she going under themperours <i>goshon</i>, and with Japon
marreners.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 6.</i>&mdash;I wrot to Antony Biscaino, pilot of Jno. Joosens junk which
is com from Camboia, to will hym to send me my letters the English
have wrot, as I understand they have.</p>

<p>We opened the ij chistes which came from Syam with <i>callamback</i> and
silk, and waid it out.</p>

<p>News came from a Japon of Langasaque to Capt. Speck that of a certen 5
or 6 frigattes of Portugezes of Amacau did meete with a small
Hollandes shipp at sea, and after fight a long tyme the Holland shipp
was sunk with ij or 3 of the friggotes, and the rest soe ill handled
that non proceaded forward but 1, which is this lately arived at
Langasaque, the capt. or cheefe wherof was lykwais slaine and many
others hurt. Capt. Speck sent me word hereof, esteeming it rather our
shipp <i class="shipname">Adviz</i> then a Hollander; but I hope it will prove contrary.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 7.</i>&mdash;I sent a letter to Alvaro Munos desiring hym to writ me the
truth of the newes of the sinking of a Duch or English shipp per the
friggattes.</p>

<p>There came news this day that the shipp which the Portingales took was
a Hollander, and that they sunk her, and
<!--056.png--><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>
have brought 50 prisoners
to Langasaque. And after came a Japon whoe said he was in the
Portingall frigattes when they laid her aboard, being iiij in all, ij
on thone syd, and ij on thother, but that in the end the Hollanders,
seeing they could keepe their shipp no longer, set their powder on
fire, and blew the ship in peeces, fyring on of the sayles of one
penisse, wherin above xx men were lost in going about to quench the
fire. This fello sayeth he was abord when the ship was fired, and
called to them in the Japon tong that, yf any Japons were in her, they
should come out and save them selves, and that one Japon was saved
only out of her, and no Hollander. But I doe not beleeve that this
fello could escape so free, yf he had byn abord when she was fired,
nether that a Japon could be saved out of her but som Hollanders would
have donne the lyke. In fine, there is so many talles that a man
knoweth not which to beleeve.</p>

<p>The umpras father came to vizet me, and brought me a <i>barso</i> of wyne
and a cuttell fish.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 8.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. with other Chinas went this day to
Langasaque to look out for retorne of ther junckes from Taccasanga and
other partes; for as yet non are com; which puteth them in feare the
Hollanders have mett with them. God keepe them out of their walke.</p>

<p>Here news came this day that the Hollandes shipp which fought with the
Portingale frigottes is at Tushma, with many hurt men in her. Others
say it is the Portingall frigot which is wanting, being one of the
iiij which boarded her and was fired. Once here is soe many tales that
a man knoweth not which to beleeve.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 9.</i>&mdash;Bongo Samma came to thenglish howse to vizet me, and said
he was glad it was a Hollander and not an English shipp which was
spoild by the Portingales. He said they were ij Holland shipps, and
that the bigger ran away and left the lesser to be spoiled; but that I
esteem a fable.</p>

<p><!--057.png--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>
<i class="day">July 10.</i>&mdash;I rec. iij Japon letters this day, i from Capt. Adams
wife, from Edo, an other from Croby Dono, Capt. Adams host at Osakay,
and the therd from Tozayemon Dono, our host at Sackay, all
complemental, Tozayemon Dono advising that silk was risen to 300 <i class="measure">tais
pico</i> at Miaco.</p>

<p>And this day came a bark from Tushma, and passed by to goe to
Langasaque to adviz the governor of the arivall of a Portingall frigat
was there arived with many wounded and hurt men in her, for that they
desired barkes to toe them from thence to Langasaque. This is on of
them which fought with the Hollanders. The other 3 are allready arived
at Langasaque.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 11.</i>&mdash;Ther came a company of players (or <i>caboques</i>) with
apes and babons sent from the <i class="title">tono</i> (or king) to play at our house, unto
whome was geven iij <i class="measure">taies</i> in small plate. They were also at the
Hollandes howse in same sort, and had ij barrs plate, is 8 <i class="measure">tais</i> vj
<i>mas</i>.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 12.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Andrea Dittis, China Capt., from
Langasaque, of a junck arived from Tacca Sanga with som hides and
sappon wood, but no silk at all, non coming thether this year from
China.</p>

<p>And I rec. an other letter from Alvaro Munos from Langasaque, wherin
he writes ther was but iiij Portingals slayne in synking the Holland
shipp, wherin were xxx Hollanders and 8 Japons, all being dead but one
Japon which escaped, who telleth the news, and that she came from
Bantam laden with cloth and som rialles of 8, with cheese and other
matters; and that the junckes which the Hollanders put their men into
at sea are retorned to Canton with all the goodes, having kild all the
Hollanders.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 13.</i>&mdash;Harnando Ximenes came this mornyng to Firando in a
small bark or friggot which came from Macasar and thought to have gon
for the Phillipinas, but was cast on the cost of Corea, and all the
men dead but 5 before they could get [to] Tushma; and is shee nomenated
<!--058.png--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>
before, which we thought had byn on of them which fought with the
Hollander which is sunck. He bringeth word that Capt. Copendall is
dead, and that the Hollanders misuse our English men in vild sort and
take them presoners in all places where they can lay handes on them.
He is not now servant of the Company, as he saith, and complayneth
much of Mr. Lucas Antonison, of his going away, and that by his meanes
he was trayned abord, and shipped away for Macosar, and his chist,
aparell, and other matters detayned from hym. So from thence he got
hither. He also sayeth that Marten Prin cometh generall of a fleet of
5 good shipps this yeare for Surat and soe for Bantam. Also he saith
(to my greefe) that my nephew Jno. Cocks is dead at Bantam, and that
he did not hear of the <i class="shipname">Advices</i> arivall at Bantam, although it
were late before he departed from thence.</p>

<p>This Spanish vessell arived at Tushma is a shipp of som 80 or 100
tonns, and, as I understand, was sent from Manillas the last yeare
laden with victuelles, to have gon for the Molucas, but never went
thether at all, but rather for Macasar, geving it out that they were
at Molucos and had in chase by ij Holland shipps, and forced to save
them selves at Macasar. But being theare, they took councell together,
and agreed to provid them selves of the needfull and to retorne for
the cost of Manilla, there to attend the coming out of the China junck
with their money, and soe to stripp them of it, thinking they might
easely doe it, and all passe under the name of Hollanders. But now,
all their people being dead, they are driven to this extremetye and
send this Scots man, called John Portis, to the Spaniardes at
Nangasaque, to excuse the matter that they were driven into these
partes by meanes of fowle wether, not having any merchandiz in the
shipp, and therefore needlesse to com to Nangasaque, and to this
effect carry a <i>bongew</i> of the King of Tushma with them to certefie as
much, thinking (as is should seeme) to provide them selves of men at
Tushma
<!--059.png--><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>
and to goe out againe upon their former pretence of
boothaling. This much Harnando Ximenes, being drunk, did discloze.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 14.</i>&mdash;This night past a howse was set on fire, but by good helpe
sowne quenched; yet many barkes of other places being in the harbour,
the men went ashore, knocking at other mens dores, calling for
buckettes, and the dores being opened they rushed in and carid away
all they could lay handes on, and undid divers pore men. But whether
serch will be made after them, it is not knowne, this justice,
Taccamon Dono, being a simple felloe.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 15.</i>&mdash;Jor. Durons writes me that yt is a Holland shipp that the
Portingall frigottes burned. Also that the Conde Redondo is com
for viz Roy of Goa (or India), and that all in generall have complained
against Don Jeronimo de Silva for his covetousnesse, desyring to have
hym sent away and an other sent to Phillippinas in his place.</p>

<p>He writes also how the King of Spaine maketh sharp warrs against the
Duke of Savoy, and that the Venetians and the Turk take the Savoyans
part. Allso that Prince Charles of England hath maried or is made sure
to the King of Spaines doughter.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 16.</i>&mdash;Yasemon Dono, Capt. Adames host, came out of Xaxma,
and hath bought store of planke and tymber secretly underhand for the
Hollanders; otherwaies the King of Xaxma would not let them have any,
being noe frend to the Hollanders. Yt is said the Hollanders meane to
make a galley of parte of this tymber to set out against the
Portingale frigotes.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 17.</i>&mdash;I rec. a letter from Jor. Durons, wherin he writes me that
it is of a certen that the shipp the Portingalles sunck is a Hollander
and no Englishman, and that they have saved many letters of the
Hollanders, which it should goe hard but he would get som of them and
send to me to put me out of dowbt of the matter. Also he writes
<!--060.png--><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
that
ther was above 20000 <i>pezos</i> or R. of 8 sunck in her, which were
sent to buy tymber in Xaxma, to make 5 or vj gallis or friggates to
set out against the Portingalles and Spaniardes, espetially them which
com from Amacou.</p>

<p>The other ij letters were from Capt. Andrea Dittis and Capt. Whow, his
brother, that the 3 junckes which went to Taccasanga, wherin the
Worll. Company had 600 <i class="measure">tais</i> adventure, are all retorned to
Langasaque without silk, non being permitted to com out of China, and
that they had sent much money into China to buy silk (from
Taccasanga), but had noe newes what was becom of men nor money.</p>

<p>I forgot to note downe how Georg Durons advized me that the cheefe
Hollander in the Indies is sunk in the shipp that was coming from
Bantam by the Portingales, and that the Holland shipp had taken ij
China junckes, which the Portingales reskewed, and retorned them to
China.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 18.</i>&mdash;A China brought me a present of a cup of

<p>Four noblemen of Crates came to see thenglish howse, viz. the cheefe
justis, the secretary, and ij other princepall men, whome I
enterteyned in the best sort I could.</p>

<p><i class="day">July 20.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames tould me this day that Capt. Speck and the
Hollanders sent to desire hym to goe up with Capt. Barkhout for Edo,
to carry their present to themperour, for that Jno. Yoosen, their
countreyman, was out of favour with themperour and other princes by
meanes of his fowle tong. So this day the kinges brother hath lent
them a bark to carry them up.</p>

<p>Jorge Durons writes me of a miraculosse matter happened in England
which, allthough I know to be a stark lye, yet I thought good to sett
downe verbatum, viz.:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><!--061.png--><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>
Yt is here reported (or spoken) for certen that in England apeared in
the fermament a very greate cros, with the crowne of thorne and
nailes, such as our Saviour Christ suffered his passion withall; and
that the Kinges Matie. of England and all his nobilletye saw it and
fell downe and worshipped it; only one prist (a bad Christian) tould
the king and the rest it was no miracle, but a fantesie. Wherupon at
an instant both the pristes eyes flew out of his head, and he died
imediatly in the sight of all men. Whereupon the King of England sent
presently to the Pope of Rome to have a learned bushope to com into
England to treate of these miraculos causes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span></p>

agrownd at Liqueas ij or 3 tymes, and out of hope at last to get her
affe, being <span class="muchsmaller"><sup>2</sup>&frasl;3</span> partes full of water, he having carid the money and

Yet in the end she floted of her owne accord, and soe they got her
(not without greate danger) to the cheefe iland of the grand Liqueas,
to the port of Naffa. But he writes, when the kinges <i>bongews</i>

sent them boates with men and all other helpe possible, to save her,
by which meanes under

God they escaped; and after sent them word to
look out thorow all his woodes and forist for tymber, plank, or what
else we stood in need of, for all was at service of thenglish nation.
But this must needes be by meanes of the King of Xaxma, whose vassale
the King of the Liqueas is, whoe had formerly geven them charge soe to
doe, as Mr. Eaton thinketh. In fine, he meanes to repare the junck
theare, and to proceed on his voyag for Syam, yf I sent hym not word
to the contrary. But I hope my letters are with hym before now, to com
away forthwith, at sight thereof, for Firando.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 4.</i>&mdash;This night past came news that the China Capt. junck
which went for Tonkin is cast away at that place by neglegence of the
pilot; but all the people saved. Som say the Japons did muten, and
carid away the money, but how trew it is I know not. Also it is
reported that both the junckes of Kitskin Dono and Semi Dono are
arived at Cochinchina, and they of the junk of Semi Dono are cozened
of 7000 <i class="measure">taies</i> of their money, being waid out to pay for silke was
stolne from them, as that was from Edmond Sayer the yeare past.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 5.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Andrea Dittis, from Langasaque,
wherin he conferms the newes of casting away Capt. Whaws junck, not
knowing whether the people were saved or no.</p>

<p>Also he writes me how Gonsalvas junck is arived from Manillas, in
whome his sonne is com from Manillas, I meane Andrea Dittis sonne, and
that Jno. Yossens junck is lykwais arived at Langasaque. He writes
also that iij shipps are arived from New Spaine at Manillas which
bring a new governor.</p>

<p>We had ij <i class="measure">pico</i> suger from Holland factory, i browne and thother
candie, to pay as rest is sould.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 7.</i>&mdash;There came news that a shipp is without, yf not ij, but
what they are is not knowne.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 8.</i>&mdash;About midnight I had news brought me that the ship
without is a Hollander, and com from Molucos, and that her mast is cut
over board, and the ship much broaken. So I sent Ed. Sayer in the
morning to the Duch howse to
<!--065.png--><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>
know the certen news, and sent out our
<i>foy fone</i> to helpe to toe her in, shee being but a littell distance
without and the wether calme. And presently after a French man,
chirurgion of the <i class="shipname">Son</i>, came to me in secret, and tould me that this
shipp without was an English shipp, and one of iiij which the
Hollanders have lately taken at Molucos, not without slaughter of many
men, and the rest taken prisoners, and sent this small shipp to bring
news hither of it, I think of spite to scorne thenglish nation. And,
as they say, an other great Holland shipp, called the <i>Black Lyon</i>, is
without, and com from Bantam. Yt is to be esteemed they have taken our
shipp which should come from Bantam, and dowbtfull they did the like
the last yeare by the <i class="shipname">Adviz</i> which Mr. Wickham went in.</p>

<p>After nowne our <i>foy fone</i> retorned from the Dutch Capt. Speck,
telling our <i>jurebasso</i> Co Jno. that yt was an English shipp they
had taken by order of war, and therefore had noe need of our helpe to
bring her in. And this tyme Co Jno. tould me that out of dowbt it was
the ship <i class="shipname">Adviz</i> that Mr. Wickham went from hence in the last yeare,
and that he saw som negros in her which were heare the last yeare. Soe
herupon I went to Oyen Dono, the kinges governor, and tould hym what
past, desiring hym to speake to Tonomon Samma, the kinges brother, to
let me have a <i>bongew</i> to goe abord this shipp betyme to morrow, to take
notis what she is, and whether the Hollanders take them selves enemies
of thenglish or no, and in what manner they have taken this shipp, to
thentent I might goe to themperour to have justice.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 9.</i>&mdash;I sent an expresse to Langasaque with letters to Andrea
Dittis and Jor. Durons, that I am to goe to Edo to aske justice aganst
the Hollanders, and that yf the Chinas will goe up about that matter I
will assist them in all I may.</p>

<p>The Hollanders brought in our shipp in a bravado, and
<!--066.png--><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>
shot affe many
guns out of her, and out of their other two. But I had forgotten to
note downe how I went to Tonomon Samma, the kinges brother, to desyre
hym to let me have a <i>bongew</i> to goe abord thenglish shipp which the
Hollanders had taken, to be a witnesse before themperour what answer
they made. But he would let me have no man, saying as yet no shipp was
com in, nether had he heard any thing of the matter till now. Soe I
retorned and sent out Mr. Osterwick, with Mr. Nealson and others, to
look upon her, to see yf they could know her or no. But they mett her
coming into the roade, and soe returned; only they spoake unto them
and bad them welcom, and much good might she doe them.</p>

<p>But sowne after (two severall tymes) Capt. Speck sent his <i>jurebasso</i>
unto me to certefie me he was sorry for what had happened, and that
the shipp and goodes were at my devotion. I both tymes retorned hym
thankes: they had pocession, and therefore might make their benefite.
Soe in the end he came to thenglish howse, accompanied with Capt.
Barkhout and Sr. Albartus, using many complementall wordes, offring
the shipp and what was in her at my comand. But yow must understand
they had well emptied her befor, having byn ij nightes and a day abord
of her before. I made them answer, I was sory for that which was
happened, and wished it had not byn soe, and that yt had byn enoffe
for them to have taken our shipp and goodes without bringing in of the
shipps in such a scornfull sort. He made me answer, they were not in
the falt, but them which sent the shipp, nether they in falte, for
that they did nothing but what their masters comanded them. &ldquo;Why
then&rdquo;, said I, &ldquo;yt seemes your mastars comand yow to be comune theevs,
to robbe English, Spanish, Portingalles, Chinas, Javas, and all others
whatsover, without respect, and to synk a French shipp going thorow
the straites of Sonday, becauce they should not carry news into France
of the
<!--067.png--><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>
abuce yow had offered them.&rdquo; These speeche did somthing move
them; soe they answered me that hitherto they had held frendshipp with
us, and still would do, till their comanders gave them order to the
contrary, and then they would doe as they thought good. Unto which I
answered they might showe them selves frendes to thenglish, yf they
pleased, ether now or hereafter, but for my parte I did not care a
halfe peny whether they did or noe. And soe they departed.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 10.</i>&mdash;We had a councell this day, wherat assisted me Ed.
Sayer, Wm. Nealson, and Jno. Osterwick, where it was debated whether
it were fiting to send up to themperour, to complaine against the
insolentie of the Hollanders in presuming not only to take our shipps,
but openly to bring them in to our disgrace. Wherupon it was concluded
that I my selfe should take that long and troblesom voyag in hand, and
that Mr. Wm. Nealson should accompany me, as well to look out and
cleare debtes above, and bring reste downe, as also to carry up with
us such matters as the factory afforded, and to buy stuffes to geve
presentes to themperour and his nobles (at least, yf they would take
them), or els to make sals therof, yf they were refuced. Also it was
ordayned to send away a post, both by water and land, after Capt.
Adams, to enforme hym of the theevery of the Hollanders, to the entent
he should retyre hym selfe from them and stay my coming, and not goe
with them before the Emperour.</p>

<p>Soe we dispached a swift bark of 5 ores away, not dowbting but they
will sowne overtake them, for that our host Tozayemon Dono of Sackay
arived heare this day, and left hym at Shimonaseak two daies past, and
I make acco. our bark will be at Shiminaseak.</p>

<p>Oyen Dono came to vizet me in the name of Tonomon Samma, offering me
all assistance against the Hollanders, and wishing me to make hast,
not dowbting but the Hollanders
<!--068.png--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>
would be driven out of Japon, yf I
made my complaint in due forme against them.</p>

<p>Also yt is tould me how the Hollanders have made a greate
<i>pancado</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span> or sale of silk to divers Japons, and the silk waid out
and sealed up, but coming to payment there is 10 <i class="measure">taies</i> in a <i class="measure">pico</i>
difference in the price, which amounteth to above 4000 <i class="measure">tais</i>. So that
much adow is lyke to be about it.</p>

<p>Oyen Dono being gon, Sugian Dono of Umbra came unto me (as from
Tonomon Samma) and wished me to make good enformations against the
Hollanders, wherin he would assist me, and made no dowbt but they
would be banishid out of the cuntrey. I desired hym that he would
assist me in the matter, and that I might be quickly dispached, to goe
up to the Emperour. Soe he went from me to the <i class="title">tono</i>, telling me
he would use such dilligence I should be dispached to morrow.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_17" id="footnote_17"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_17"><span class="muchsmaller">[17]</span></a>
 Span.: <i>pancada</i>, contract for sale in gross.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 11.</i>&mdash;I went to Tonomon Samma, or rather he sent for me, to
know whether I ment to goe to themperour or no, to complaine against
the Hollanders. And I answered hym, yea. &ldquo;But&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;do yow
pretend to comence any processe against them?&rdquo; To which I answered,
noe, for that I would seek justice against them in England; only my
pretence was to geve themperor to understand they were comune theeves
and sea rovers and took all men they met withall, without exception,
were they frendes or foes; and that his Matie. might doe well to
embarg their shipps and goodes till he better understood the truth
thereof, and not suffer them to carry out victuelles and munition and
money as they did, and to keepe two or 3 shipp to goe a roveing as
they did this last yeare, to take Chinas and all others they mett
withall under culler of them; which they could not doe, had they not
this receptacle. Yt seemed he lyked my answer well, and wished
<!--069.png--><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>
me
to proceed therin formally, and that he for his parte would [geve]
assistance in what he could, and write to the king his brother at
large thereof, whome he knew would take my parte against them, as not
haveing yet forgotten the complaint they made against hym to
themperour the last yeare; and that I needed not to carry any <i>bongew</i>
up with me, in respect the kynge hym selfe was theare, whoe he knew
would assist me in person to goe to themperour and his councell.</p>

<p>We agreed with a bark this day to cary us to Osakay for lx <i class="measure">tais</i>
plate bars.</p>

<p>There was som which came and tould me this day that Tonomon Samma, the
kinges brother, and others asked the Hollanders wherefore they tooke
Englishmen and their shipping in this sort; unto which Capt. Speck
answered, it was because we brought shott, powder, lead, and other
munition, and sould it to their enemies. &ldquo;Why&rdquo;, said the other, &ldquo;are
the Englishmen your vasselles that they are bound to observe what yow
would have them, and may not they doe as they please with that which
is their owne to any one they esteem their frendes? As&rdquo;, said he,
&ldquo;they bring lead and such other matters as themperour hath need of
yearly, which now it seemeth yow have taken, that non is lyke to com
this yeare. Soe that&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;this will make much against yow.&rdquo;
Whereunto Capt. Speck has littell to replie.</p>

<p>I gave Matinga a silke <i>keremon</i>, a <i>catabra</i> of same, and an upper
garment of fine white casho.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 13.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Capt. Adames to same effect as the
former, and sent it per our hostice of Bingana Tomo to send it from
thence expres.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 14.</i>&mdash;Tonomon Samma, the kinges brother, sent for me to come
and speake with hym; which I did, and fownd that the Portingalles had
againe made complaint against Harnando Ximines and Jno. Portus, saying
they
<!--070.png--><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>
were murtherers of their capt., with many other falce reportes
of them, desyring to have them deliverd into their handes. Unto which
I answerd, that, yf the Portingales had anything to doe with them,
they should goe before themperour, wheare I would answer for them, and
to their shame prove their reportes falce.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 17.</i>&mdash;I wrott ij letters, i to Bantam, directed to Capt.
Balle, and thother to Camboja, directed to Mr. Georg Savidg, with the
former in it rec. back from Nicholas Marin. And these letters I
deliverd to Andrea Dittis, who gave conveance to them per way of
China.</p>

<p>Capt. Speck sent for Mr. Osterwick to com and speake with hym, of
which he tould me, and I bad hym goe and knowe what was the matter.
Soe at his retorne he said the cheefe occation was for that I spoke
ill of their comanders
<!--072.png--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>
or generalls of the Indies, wishing me to
refrayne my tong, or else to take heed of my selfe. Also he said he
sat still in his howse and said nothing tuching thenglish, as also
that there could nothing be done in thenglish howse but that he knew
it within xxiiij howers after; and that he held me for a furious and
hastie man which misused all thenglishmen in the howse, and did all
thinges on my owne head and spleene without taking councell. The first
point of these speeches Jno. Osterwick made knowne unto me, and the
rest tould unto other Englishmen which gave me to understand therof. I
dowbt this Jno. Osterwick, because his father was a Duchman, and it
may be he dealeth dubly.</p>

<p>Soe, being tuched soe neare by this prating Duchman, I took occation
to write hym a letter in Spanish, the coppie wherof I have extant, in
which I advized that I marveld much he medled in my howsehould
affares, braging that nothing could be donne but he knew it within
xxiiij howrs after, esteeming me a hasty, furious, and he might as
well have said, a madd man, doing all thinges on spleene without
councell. Unto which I answerd that I desyred to know my accusers,
which yf he did not manifest, and that yf any man went upon spleene or
ill will to geve out or speake such ill and falce reportes of me, that
he or they lied in their throtes. And whereas he said he sat still in
his howse and said nothing tuching thenglish nation, my answer was,
they hadd not geven hym nor them any occation hitherto, nether in
taking of shipping, killing of men, and robing them of their goodes.
And, yf I spoke ill of their generall, I did it upon a good grownd,
holding hym as an enemy to my soverigne lord the Kinges Matie. of
England and his estate in taking of shiping, killing his Matis.
subjectes, and bereving them of their goodes. And as tuching his
thretnyng speeches, I did not well understand his meanyng, but gave
hym to understand I did nether feare his wordes nor weapons.</p>

<p><!--073.png--><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>
He also sent me word that I might make what hast I would to themperour
to make complaint, and that he would follow after at his leasure, and
that I could doe nothing till he came. Unto which I answerd in my
letter that I went not up to themperour to demand restetution of shipp
nor goodes, for I was assured to have satisfaction in England, and
therefore he was deceaved in that matter, and might ether goe up or
tarry at home yf he list.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 19.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Capt. Adams dated the 13th
present, at a place 10 leagues beyond Camyna Seke, wherin he writes me
of the wrack of many barkes, and that the governors bark of provition
is all cast over bord but one peece of ordinance. And that Touan Dono
hath lost his processe, all his goodes confiscat, and his lyfe at
Emperours pleasure. Also that a China bark or junk arived in Xaxma
with much silk, which he had taken from other Chinas and sould it at
Miaco for 220 <i class="measure">tais</i> the <i class="measure">pico</i>; but themperour, coming to know they
are theeves, hath geven them into the handes of other Chinas, to have
the goods retorned to whome they belong, and execution to be donne
upon the offenders.</p>

<p>And this day news is com from Capt. Whow that it is not Niquans junk
which is cast away, but an other, smaller, of not halfe themportance,
but belonging to same owners.</p>

<i class="day">August 23.</i>&mdash;We set forward on our voyag towardes Edo this mornyng
about 6 a clock in the mornynge, and at night came to an anker at

there remayned all the rest of day and night following, wind being a

and 19 to short of Shimnaseaque. Here we understood of a small China
junck which was entred into a port of Faccatay, 4 leagues hence,
called Ginushma, being driven thither per contrary windes, but bound
for Firando, laden with suger, purselon, and other matters. But the

<p><i class="day">August 27.</i>&mdash;I was enformed this day that the China junk which was at
Ginushma, 3 leagues hence, was one of the 3 which the Hollanders took
and put their men into. These Chinas, having lost the sight of the
Holland shippe, made the 7 Hollanders drunk that were put into the
junk, and then cut their throtes; but, the wind being contrary, they
could not retorne for China, but passed by Firando and soe put into
Faccatay, where they staid not longe but put to sea againe, thinking
them selves to neare Firando, where the Hollanders are; and are gone,
as the report is, to a harbor on the north part of Japan, called
Quitamare. Some are of opinion that the junk which put into the back
side of Xaxma or Bongo, whome went to Miaco to sell their silke, was
lykwais one of them, although it were geven out they

Donos wife. He also advized me that I should not think ill of hym, yf
he ware forward in wordes to speake in the Hollanders behalfe in

complementall wordes and offers of greate frenshipp, and that he
wanted not to labour to get our dispach. I retorned his Highnes many
thankes; but rather imagin he standeth in dowbt we goe about to get
lycense to send our shiping to Langasaque, in respect we desire to be
apart from the Hollanders, and in that he is not deceaved. But whether
it will take effect or no, I know not, only the Emperours factor sent

Hollanders; but he went away without it, although he saw me have it in
my hand. So I gave it to his secretary, Cacakayemon Dono, whoe of hym
self promised me to deliver it to hym at his retorne.</p>

but did nothing, most of the Councell being gon to honer a pagod where
Ogosho Samas was bured, 3 daies journey hence, the seremony being to
be observed the 17th day of this moone after Japon stile, which was
the day of this buriall.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 23.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames was all day at Cort to get our dispach,
but retorned without doing of any thing.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 24.</i>&mdash;Not having busynes to doe by meanes the Councell were
abcent about seremones of the ould Emperours mortuary, we went and
vizeted the pagod of Otongo, which these people hould to be the god of
darknes (or hell), as the antientes called Pluto. It standes on the
topp of a hill which overlooketh all Edo, and the idoll (or picture)
of Otongo is made in forme lyke a devill, with a hooked nose and feete
lyke a griffon, and riding upon a wild boare. He was painted after
severall formes, but allwais monted upon a wild boare, which the
people say was his blason or armes. And for that entent there is a
greate wild boare alive kept in a cage (or frank) at the foote of the
hill, which I saw at my entrance. And there goeth an upright peare of
[s]ton staie[r]s of 69 stepps, of a lardg breadth, leading directly up
to the pagod; but an easier way is to goe compas about the hill. There
was many people went to vizet that place, and their use is to goe 3
tymes rownd about the pagod mumbling out serten prayers. This I marked
of dyvers.</p>

<p>From thence we went to an other pagod, where the eldest
<!--092.png--><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>
sonne of
Ogosho Samma (a valient man) lyeth bured in a stately monument. This
pagod is the seate of the greate or high bushopp of Japon, next after
the <i>deyre</i>. His people used us very kyndly, and opened the dores
of the monument, and let us enter in, and opened the secret place
where the idoll of the dececed was placed, whereat all the Japons fell
prostrate and adored it. And from thence they led us into the bushops
chappell or oratory, all sett out with idolls and lamps, nether more
nor lesse then in the papist churches, before which idolls the Japons
did likewais fall downe and worship. This pagod (or monestery) was
erected to the honor of Amida, a greate saint of China, equaled with
Shacca. And I gave an <i>ichebo</i> to them which shewed us these matters,
and so retorned hom.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 25.</i>&mdash;Fongo Dono, the ould admerall, sent me a present of
frute with a letter from his manor howse, 17 leagues hence.</p>

<p>Capt. Adames was all day at Cort to get our dispach; but had nothing
from the Councell but a nod and smiling countenance.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 26.</i>&mdash;Mr. Nealson did but ask Capt. Adames for 10 shire maps
without frames, which per his acco. he hath resting in his handes; but
he fell into such a chafe about that matter, telling them which were
about hym, in the Japon tong, that this was not the first tyme we had
charged hym with falce accomptes and after reconynges. Truly I was
ashamed to heare hym in such a humor; yet, after, yt seemed he
recanted, for he came to me and asked me yf I know of any such matter.
And I answerd hym, it apered by Mr. Eatons accompt that he had them,
wherof I know yow (<i>sic</i>) have a coppie under his owne hand. So he
went away, and said nothing to the contrary.</p>

<p>Matabio Oye Dono, our host of Oisa,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span> sent me a letter with a
present of 2 greate fyshes, to know whether I were
<!--093.png--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>
in health or no,
for that I was sick in his howse, and not heard any news whether I
were recoverd or noe. He sent this man 16 leagues with this present
only to see how I did. So I gave his man an <i>ichebo</i> of gould to pay
for his horshier and wrot a letter to his master.</p>

<p>We went this day to vizet a greate temple of Yemia Fachman, the god of
war, with an other god, as they take it, joyned with hym, which every
18th day of eache moone the people goe on pilgremage to offer to the
shrines; and this was the 18th day, which made me the more willing to
goe to see it being accomplished, with Capt. Adames, Mr. Nealson, and
others. And I doe verely thinke there were above 100,000 people, men,
women, and children, which went this day upon devotion to that place,
and in many places in the way were comodies (or plaies) to be seene,
and other showes; and before the temple the sorserars or witches stood
dansing, with knottes or bunches of hawcks belles made fast to sticks,
which they held in their hands, mumbling over sertayne prayers. But
that which I tooke most note of was of the liberaletie and devotion of
these heathen people, whoe thronged into the pagod in multetudes, one
after an other, to cast money into a littell chapell before the
idalles, most parte, or rather all which I could see, being <i>gins</i> or
bras money, whereof 100 of them may vallie som 10<i>d.</i> str., and are
about the bignes of a 3<i>d.</i> English money; which coyne (or brasse
money) they cast in by handfulles, and then came out of the temple,
delivered a writing to one that sat within the dore, who piled them
one on the top of the other. And so the pilgrams turned on the left
hand of the entry of the pagod, and in a gallery went 3 tymes about
it, and soe departed away. There was many 100 of gentellmen which went
on horsback to doe these devotions in the forme as afforsaid.</p>

<p>And soe, as we retorned, we went into a <i>vento</i><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span>
or tavarne, <!--094.png--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>
where
we dyned of presentes and bankets which were brought us; and gave to
the howse 500 <i>gins</i>, and the servantes 100 ditto.</p>

<p>Cacayemon Dono came to vizet me, and tould me many matters, how his
master and all the rest of the Councell were offended against the
Hollanders, etc.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 27.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adams went to Cort about our busynes, and there
saw Jno. Yoosen, the Hollander, delivering up a present to themperour
and getting out a <i>goshon</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Nealson envited Cacayemon Dono and Torazemon Dono to supper this
night, and had the dansing beares.</p>

<p>This day at 4 clock after nowne an earthquak.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 28.</i>&mdash;Chauno Shrogero Dono, Emperours factor, sent me a
letter of his retorne to Edo; and I retorned hym answer, desiring his
frendship to procure us Emperours <i>goshon</i> to carry our shiping
to Langasaque.</p>

<p>Capt. Adams went againe to Cort, to gett our dispach, but retorned
only with a nodd from the counsellors, with a smile. Also he
understood that for 3 daies space Jno. Yoosens present is not yet
deliverd, although he tendered it each day. And I had forgotten to
note downe that Caquemon Dono, secretary of Oyen Dono, tould me that
the said Yoosen brought a present to his master, which he asked hym
whether it were stolne goodes or noe, for that, said he, the
Hollanders are now well knowne to be comune theevs, etc.</p>

<p>Also, Capt. Adams being at Cort, Oyen Dono asked hym wherefore he
came; whereunto he answered that he came for the dispach of thenglish
Capt. &ldquo;Whie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is he not gon? It is almost a month past since
I thought he had byn gon.&rdquo; This he spoake in hearing of Jno. Yoosen,
and soe went away laughing, for what event I know not, only Capt.
Adames thought it was in mocking ye Hollanders.</p>

<p><!--095.png--><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>
<i class="day">October 29.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames went to castell to have gotten our
dispach, but retorned without doing any thing, the Emperour being gon
to looke on them which shott at blank with hand guns or kalivers.</p>

<p>Also he saw Jno. Yoosen, the Hollander, still with his present
unreceaved, attending their pleasures.</p>

<p>Capt. Adames went to Cort to get our dispache, and the Councell gave
hym order to com to them to morow morning, for that they would talke
with hym. The Emperour went this day a fowling, and with his owne
handes kild 5 elkes (or wild swans), which coming out to send them
abroad to his brothers and frendes (after his retorne to his pallace
or castell), he saw Jno. Yoosen stand in a corner with his present,
and asked what he was; and, being knowne, he went away asking whether
he were a Hollander, and yt was answersd hym yea. &ldquo;Whie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it
is reported this fellow is much indebted and will not pay his
creditors.&rdquo; Unto which a frend of his answered, it was to the
Hollanders, his cuntremen, and to noe others; wherin his frend lied,
for he oweth to divers others. Yet upon this report his present was
receaved.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 31.</i>&mdash;I went and vizeted Chawno Shrogero Dono, and desird hym
to be a meanes to get our dispach; and he tould me he would, and for
our going to Langasaque with our shiping, we might doe it yf we would,
as well as to Firando, for that it was all one to this Emperour, soe
we might doe it.</p>

<p>Capt. Adames went to Cort, as the Councell did bid hym, but attended
most parte of the day, and then retorned without geting out our
dispache.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 1.</i>&mdash;This day we reconed with Yadeo Dono, partner with
Neamon Dono; but much trowble we had with hym, for he would have put
lodghier, incomiendo, and servantes wages to acco. for goodes sould,
and yet have kept all the profit to them selves, over and above the
bare
<!--096.png--><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>
prise left with them, they having, upon my knowledg, sould it for
much more. Also he would have put som thinges sould at a lower price
then it was left at, with other unreasonable matters. Soe I referd all
to Capt. Adames to make an end of it, without going to law, where I am
ashewered we should have fownd small right, as I have known per
experience.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 2.</i>&mdash;Jno. Yoosen came to vizet me, and brought me a present
of sweet meates, enviting me hom to his howse, etc. Yt seemed by his
speeches he was not well pleaced with the Hollanders liberallety
towardes hym, considering the paynes he had taken for them, for which
he hath the ill will of the <i class="title">Tono</i> of Firando and divers others.</p>

<p>Capt. Adames went to Cort to get our dispache, but themperour was gon
out a hawking and the Councell a feasting; soe nothing was donne.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 3.</i>&mdash;I receved three letters per expres, viz.:&mdash;1 from Ed.
Sayer and Jno. Osterwick, dated in Firando, 2th October; 1 from Capt.
Whaw, China Capt., at Langasaque; 1 from Jno. <i>jurebasso</i> at
Firando&mdash;all to sett out 2 <i>goshons</i> for Chinas, yf I can, one for
Tonkin, and other for Taccasanga.</p>

<p>Capt. Adames went to Cort to get our dispach, but retorned without
doing anything. Only Oyen Dono asked hym whether I were gon or no.
Unto whome he answerd, how I could goe without lycence of themperour.
So he tould hym I did well, and that we should forthwith be dispached.</p>

<p>There was 3 Japons of Langasaque with presentes to get out <i>goshons</i>
for Cochinchina; but they and their presentes were sent away without
any answer, but that they might com an other tyme, viz. Capt.
Barnardo, Cutarro or Gotarro, Manuel Gonzalves man.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 4.</i>&mdash;I went to Oyen Dono, accompanid with Capt. Adams and
Mr. Nealson, and by good fortune met
<!--097.png--><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>
hym in the street at his owne
dore, desyring his Lordshipp to get us our dispach from themperour,
which he promised to procure forthwith, being ashamed (as he said) we
staid soe longe, and with all tellinge me he was beholden to me.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 5.</i>&mdash;Yisternight at 10 a clock was an earthquake, which for
a good while shooke very much.</p>

<p>Capt. Adames went to Cort to get our dispache, and was answerd we
should be dispached to morow. The Japons presentes, which came for
<i>goshons</i>, were receved.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 6.</i>&mdash;The Emperour sent me 20 silk <i>keremons</i> (or coates) for
a present, wherof I gave 2 to Capt. Adames, 2 to Mr. Nealson, and 1 to
our host of Miaco, Magazemon Dono.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 7.</i>&mdash;I forgot to note downe that there was a comett (or
blasing star) which hath appeared this 5 or 6 daies som hower before
day, easterly, a littell to the southwards; but it is so neare the
sunne that we could see nothing but the teale, yt being of a hudg
leangth, and doth, by littell and littell, draw to the westward,
sotherly.</p>

<p>Also this day I went and took my leave of all the lordes of the
Councell, but spoake with none but Oyen Dono.</p>

<p>And, as we retorned, about 10 a clock, hapned a greate earthquake,
which caused many people to run out of their howses. And about the
lyke hower the night following hapned an other, this cuntrey being
much subject to them. And that which is comunely marked, they allwais
hapen at a hie water (or full sea); so it is thought it chanseth per
reazon is much wind blowen into hollow caves under grownd at a loe
water, and the sea flowing in after, and stoping the passage out,
causeth these earthquakes, to fynd passage or vent for the wind shut
up.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 8.</i>&mdash;We dyned at King of Firandos brothers, where we were
kindly entertayned, and I carid him a <i>barso</i> of wyne and a fresh
salmon for a present.</p>

<p><!--098.png--><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>
The people in this place did talke much about this comett seene, that
it did prognosticate som greate matter of warr, and many did ask me
whether such matters did happen in our cuntrey, and whether I knew
what it did meane or would ensue therof; unto which I answerd that
such many tymes have byn seene in our partes of the world, but the
meanyng therof God did know and not I.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 9.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adams was sent for to Cort about our <i>goshon</i> of
last yeare, to know what junk it went in to Cochinchina, and, as it is
thought, Andrea Dittis, the China Capt., hath deceaved me, and
delivered my <i>goshon</i> to Seme Dono at Firando and served his turne in
his junck, which now is com out. These matters are com to light per
meanes of seeking out the truth of sturrs which happened in
Cochinchina with Japons against Chinas, whereof the King of
Cochinchina advized themperour of their unrulynesse; soe that it is
thought noe <i>goshons</i> will be geven out for that place this
yeare.</p>

<p>The comet apered this mornynge greater then any tyme before.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 10.</i>&mdash;I went to Chawna Shogero Dono this morning to desire
hym to get out our <i>goshon</i>, which he promised me he would, and
desird to buy som corall of me, yf I had any. Soe I sent hym that
which I had, out of which he took 9 <i>mas</i> 4 <i>condrin</i> wight, and would have
sent me money for it; but I gave it hym.</p>

<p>Towardes night Torazemon Dono and an other gentellman came to vizet me
from King of Firando, unto whome I made knowne how Semy Dono had used
me about my <i>goshon</i>, which was thoccation I was staied heare soe long
tyme without my dispach from themperour.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 11.</i>&mdash;I went and tooke leave of King of Firando, I being
ready to retorne to morrow for Miaco, and fownd him very weake and
sick; yet he gave me very kind entertaynment, and wrott letters (as he
tould me) to
<!--099.png--><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>
his brother and Semy Dono, to pay me the rest of money
he oweth to the Company and to doe me justice against Gorezano and all
others.</p>

<p>And before night Torazemon Dono and &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; wrot me a joynt letter
to deliver them my <i>goshon</i> for use of Semi Dono; which I denyed, and
wrot them answer therof.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 12.</i>&mdash;I went to Cawno Shogero Dono about the report geven
out of selling my <i>goshon</i>, and he tould me that the capt. of Semi
Donos junck is com up and witnesseth that Semi Dono sould hym my
<i>goshon</i> for 300 <i class="measure">taies</i>; so that, yf the matter should com in
question before the Emperour, it would cost som men their lives. Yet,
for his parte, he would doe the best he could to amend all, and said
it was better I stayd here 2 or 3 daies to se all ended, for, yf I
went away, nothing would be donne.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 13.</i>&mdash;The comet doth contynew still till this day, drawing
towardes W. southerly.</p>

<p>About 10 a clock at night a fyer began in the north parte of the citty
of Edo; but it was calme wether; otherwais much hurt had byn donne.
Yet ther were a few howses of pristes (or <i>boses</i>) servantes with 5
pagon temples burned in 3 divers places a greate distance one from an
other, many merchantes howses and tradesmens howses betwixt, and yet
it passed over all them without doing harme, and only burned downe the
other, as aforsaid; which many esteeme a handy work of God.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 14.</i>&mdash;I forgot to note downe how the night past, when the
fire was neare to the King of Firandos howse and Cakayemon Donos, I
sent 8 or 10 men to have holpen them, yf need required; but the
streetes were so stopped that non could passe but one as a messenger,
to tell them of my good meanyng, which they took in good part.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 15.</i>&mdash;There was presentes geven to Andrea and Maddalyna,
his wife, Mrs. Adams sister, in repect they had
<!--100.png--><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>
sent us presentes of 2
<i class="measure">barsos</i> wyne, frute, and a fresh salmon, and came from Orengaua, 2
daies journey, to vizet us, viz. 1 peece velvett, 1 pece damask, and 5
<i>mas</i> wight corall.</p>

<p>Mr. Nealson fell sick on a sudden of a fever with a bloody flux, in
greate extremety; so we sent for one of kinges chirurgions, to take
his councell, Mr. Nealson being very ernest to be lett blood; but he
councelled the contrary, saying it was nothing but an extreme cold he
had taken which drove hym into this excesse or fever, which, out of
dowbt, was his syting in his shert and a gowne 2 or 3 howrs together
on the topp of the howse, to look at the fyre when the pagods were
burned 2 nightes past.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 16.</i>&mdash;Yisternight about 10 a clock was an other fyre.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 17.</i>&mdash;We went to see the Emperours eldest brothers howse,
called Shrongo Samma, being envited to doe it per the ould Emperours
cook, who sent me a present at Shrongo and came hither and vizeted me
2 or 3 tymes since with presentes, besides this frenship. So I sent
hym a peece of damask for a present.</p>

<p>This howse we saw cost the workmanshipp, besides the tymber and all
other stuffe, 34000 bars of Oban gould at 13<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> str. per bar.
And his 2 yonger brothers have made 2 other howses adjoynying unto yt,
not much inferior to the others. And it is to be considered that all
these buildinges are of tymber, covering and all, but soe guilded over
with gould, both within and without, that it sheweth most gloriouse to
the eye, but endureth but 20 or 30 yeares, and then build an other
new; which they accompt a greate glory and take it a base thing to
dwell in a howse builded by his predecessors.</p>

<p>Capt. Adames went to Court againe to get our dispach, but did nothing.
Soe he talked with Chawno Shogero Dono about my departure from hence
to morrow, I having
<!--101.png--><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span>
busynes at Miaco and else where, and that Capt.
Adames, havyng busynes to stay heare 4 or 5 daies after me, might
bring it with hym.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 18.</i>&mdash;We departed from Edo this day, after nowne, and gave
presentes as followeth:&mdash;To Capt. Adames 2 <i>tatta</i> black cloth, and
one peece damask; and to Mrs. Adames 1 peece cushen velvett, 1 peece
damaske, and 5 <i>mas</i> wight corall; and to Mrs. Adames sonne Josephe 1
pec. velvet; and to his doughter Susanna 1 pec. damask; and to his
wives mother 1 pec. damask; and to Tome Dono, <i>jurebasso</i>, 1 pec.
taffety; and to Jacobe Dono, his clark, 1 pec. taffety. And geven to
servantes in house 2800 <i>gins</i>; and paid for our diet 160 <i class="measure">tais</i>.</p>

<p>And so we went to bed to Sheningaua, 2 leagues from Edo; and paid
charges, supper and breckfast, 4:&nbsp;1:&nbsp;6, and to servantes 400 <i>gins</i>.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 19.</i>&mdash;An hower before day we saw an other comet (or blasing
starr) rising just east, in the constellation of Scorpio. It is a
mighty comet, and, in my opinion, bigger then that which was seene
when Sebastian, King of Portingall, was slayne in Barberry.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span></p>

roade this day, but, waying ancor too sowne, was put to the northward
of Foynes Iland, and lost an ancor of 27 C. wight; and, yf she had not
quickly let fall an other, had byn in greate danger, the currant
driving her to windward, against the seyles and above 20 boates which
toed her to leeward. Yet, God be praised, the second ancor held and
staid her till tide turned. The Duch sent 4 barks to toe her out, and
I the lyke; and Capt. Spek and others came abord to bidd Capt. Pring
fare well.</p>

<p><i class="day">December 8</i> (<i class="day">Shimutsque 24</i>).&mdash;The Duch shippe <i class="shipname">Trowe</i> went out to
Cochie road this day; and I sent out 4 barkes to helpe to toe her, as
they did the like to the <i class="shipname">James Royall</i> yistarday.</p>

<p>We bought the howse Oque Dono our overthwart neighbor, for 1 C. x

in the junck <i class="shipname">Godspeed</i>.</p>

<p><i class="day">December 9</i> (<i class="day">Shimutsque 25</i>).&mdash;I rec. 3 letters from Nangasaque, viz.

And som speeches are geven out that our men above, at Edo, are kept

because he had no tyme to envite them to dynner.</p>

<p>Also the king sent 3 men to put us in mynd that he hadd ordayned them

kept the presoners; for which the muteners sware by flesh and fell

that shipps company, and wrot those lynes to the <i class="shipname">Palsgraves</i> company

the shipp <i class="shipname">Moone</i>, admerall, both of the English and Duch, where it
was debated what course they ment to take when they went out, being
now ready to sett seale. And I gave all the cheefe comanders in our 4
shipps each one a remembrance of my opinion tuching this pretended
voyage for Manillias, and that I understood there is xxiiij China
junckes bound this yeare for Manillias, and the course they ment to
take as apereth per coopie of that remembrance dated in Firando
yistarday, being the 1th of January 1620, curant.</p>

Emperors councell tould our men at Edo they hadd wrott hym to doe it.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 4</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 22</i>).&mdash;I went to the Duch howse to see the laying
out of the presentes to geve to noblemen, as per councell ordayned.
And at that instant the King of Firando departed towards Miaco and soe
for Edo, the Hollanders shooting affe store of chambers and ordinance.
And I went after in a bark with Capt. Speck, and we carid hym 3 jarrs
concerves, i C. vj. <i>cattis</i> grose tare, wherof 34 <i>cattis</i> grosse

<p><i class="day">January 6</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 24</i>).&mdash;Capt. Speck, Capt. Leonard, Albartus, and
Mattias envited themselves to our <i>fro</i> and supped at English howse.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 7</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 25</i>).&mdash;We envited our neighbours to supper on
Tewsday next, which provided thinges for our shipping, with the
gunfounders, master carpenters, and smiths.</p>

Ducuco and 1 from Ticham Shofno, ij of the Emperor of Chinas councell;
but the last from Ticham Shofnos sonne, his father being slaine in the
Tartarian warr; they sending me word that we may have free trade into
China, and the rather for that the ould king hath delivered up the
goverment of China to his sonne.</p>

<p>All our neighbours that weare envited on Sunday last came to dyner
this day, and had the <i>fro</i> heate[d], and a play of <i>caboques</i>, unto
whome I sent two bars of plate containing viij <i class="measure">taies</i> vj <i>mas</i>.</p>

<p>Capt. Speck came to me late to desire me to look out for Capt. Adames
<i>goshon</i> to get Japons goe in his junck for Bantam, he standing
in dowbt that Andreas, Capt. Adams woamans brother in law, is gone to
Nangasaque to make it away to others.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 10</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 28</i>).&mdash;I wrott 2 letters into China per conveance
of Andrea Dittis, 1 to Chisian Dicuco and 1 to Ticham Shofno, of
recept 2 chenes gould, with other complementall matters.</p>

<p>I lent my <i>goshon</i> to Andrea Dittis, China Capt., and

Itamia Migell

to me, voyadg enden, under a recept geven me in Japons, fermed per
both.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 11</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 29</i>).&mdash;I was suretie for China Capt. for 1500
<i class="measure">tais</i> plate barrs, taken up at intrest at 2 per cento per month from
first of later moone of <i class="day">Shiwas</i>, being the 13th of this month of
January, antedated 2 daies, for 7 month space; which is to be sent
into China with 1500 <i class="measure">taies</i> more from China Capt. to procure free
trade into China; which not taking effect, the China Capt. is to repay
the 1500 <i class="measure">tais</i> back, with the intrest, for Honble. Companis use.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 12</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 30</i>).&mdash;We sent our <i>jurebasso</i>, Tome Dono, with
the Hollands <i>jurebasso</i>, to Nangasaque, with a letter to Gonrok Dono,
with good wordes once more to desire his Lordshipp to take the lead as
the Councell sett price.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 13</i> (<i class="day">Second Shiwas 1</i>).&mdash;Andrea Dono, Capt. Addames brother in
law at Edo, arived heare this day, and brought the <i>goshon</i> of Capt.
Adams from themperour, which Capt. Speck soe much desireth to make use
of to sett out their junck for Bantam, otherwais she will loose her
voyag this year (as she did the last). Soe I made it knowne to Andrea,
who tould me he dowbted to doe it, in respeck of the badd tong of Jno.
Yoosen that kept such a bawling at Emperours court against it. Soe he
thought nether Capt. Speck nor I would be an occation to disgrace the
children of the deceased Capt. Adams, whome we weare bound rather to
favour then otherwais. And that which was more, he had, in the
childrens behalfe, bought the halfe of a junck at Nangasaque, wherin
he ment to goe hym selfe and make use of the <i>goshon</i> lawfully. Unto
whome I answered that he might make acco. that nether Capt. Speck nor
my selfe ment not to doe any thing prejuditiall to our deceased
frendes children in any sort whatsoever, but yf he
<!--131.png--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>
had bought halfe
that junck, that Capt. Speck should take and quit hym of that losse
and all other dangers that might ensue; and that upon necessitie it
was as fitt our frendes should make use of it as a China or any other
stranger. Soe we agreed to morow morning to goe to Capt. Speck and
take councell about it.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 14</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 2</i>).&mdash;I went to the Holland howse about the
<i>goshon</i>, and cald Andreas thither, to perswade hym to deliver it to
me and lett the Hollanders make use thereof to the most benefite of
Capt. Adams children. But he answerd me he hadd sent it overland from
Shimena Seak to Nangasaque by one of Mrs. Adams men. Yet, before, he
tould me it was heare at Firando, but that he could not let me nor noe
other have it, in respect he had promised it to one Goquan, a China,
and had bought the one halfe of his junck. And then I asked hym whoe
gave hym authoretie to dispose of this <i>goshon</i>, I sending it up
to be renewed, without taking my councell herein. Unto which he could
make noe answer. Soe I required a writing at his hand of sending the
<i>goshon</i> from Ximina Seak, and therin he promised me to use meanes to
retorne it to me, and would goe to morow with me to Nangasaque to
performe it.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 15</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 3</i>).&mdash;I was enformed Andreas sent away a boate at
midnight past to Nangasaque, to adviz his consortes of my demand for
the <i>goshon</i>. Soe this day at nowne I went towards Nangasaque about
that matter and our leade, and desird Andrea to goe with me as he
promised, and went to his lodging with my bark to call for hym; and he
sent me word he would com after in a bark of his owne.</p>

<p>Soe we went this night 12 leagues on our way, and came to an ancor.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 16</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 4</i>).&mdash;We arived at Nangasaque this day at 3 a
clock in the after nowne, but Andrea was not com. And I fownd Tome
Dono, our <i>jurebasso</i>, whoe hadd
<!--132.png--><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>
spoaken with Gonrok Dono about my
plito with Cuemon Dono of Nangasaque for the bords and tymber; and he
tould hym he would refer it till he came to Firando 10 or 12 dais
hence, and then end it before Tonomon Samma, the king&rsquo;s brother, whome
had spoaken about the matter before.</p>

<p>Also I sent to Jenquese Dono, Mrs. Adams frend, to adviz hym of my
being heare and wherabout I came; yet he came not to me.</p>

<p>And at night Itamia Migell Dono came to vizet me with Hollands ost and
divers others, and brought me a banket with ij <i class="measure">barsos</i> wyne and ij
wilduckes; and Palus (? Pauls) father a basket orenges and 18 small
lobstars.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 17</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 5</i>).&mdash;I sent to Gonrok Dono and Feze Dono of my
arivall and that I would vizet them to morow or next day. But Gonrok
made a feast to princepall in this place.</p>

<p>Andrea arived heare and sent me word he was aweary, yet ment sowne
after to com and speak with me.</p>

<p>Many presentes were sent unto me.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 18</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 6</i>).&mdash;Andrea of Edo came to me after nowne and
tould me he could not nor would not deliver the <i>goshons</i> unto me,
telling me he did that which he did by order from Capt. Adams woman.
Unto which I answered that that woaman had nothing to doe with it, but
her children, whom I had charg over and not shee. And then he answerd
me, she (or he for her) had taken all the paines and disburced the
money to buy presentes to get out the 2 <i>goshons</i>. But, at same
instant, Tozayemon Dono standing by answerd that he had delivered iij
C. and odd <i class="measure">taies</i> to Jenquese, Capt. Adames man, he demanding it for
that purpose, this plate belonging to the deceased Capt. Adames. Soe I
then demanded of Andrea whoe disburced this plate, he or I? Unto which
he could answer nothing; but Tozayemon Dono desired me to refer the
matter to hym till to morow, and he would end it to both our contentes.</p>

<p><!--133.png--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>
And this day we went to dyner to Itamia Migell Dono, where we had kind
entertaynment and great cheare with <i>caboques</i>.</p>

<p>And I sent my packes of letters to Firando, to goe in the Hollandes
junckes for Bantam and Syam.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 19</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 7</i>).&mdash;We were envited to dyner to Kitskin Donos
howse, and hadd good entertaynment.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 20</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 8</i>).&mdash;A Portugez called Augustino de Fiquira came
to me and desyred a letter to Capt. Speck to retorne hym a slave of
his which was in cure of the &mdash;&mdash; in the Duch howse, as he understood,
his name being Francisco Mallabar. Of the which I gave hym a letter
with the slaves name, with my opinion the keeping of such a slave
would doe us nether creddit nor profitt.</p>

<p>And we were envited to dynner to Groby Dono, the Hollandes host at
this place, where we had greate cheare, with the dansing beares.</p>

<p>And at last cast Tozayemon Dono sent me word, now I have staid 2 dais
at his request, that Andrea and the rest will doe nothing.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 21</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 9</i>).&mdash;I went to Gonrok Dono to demand justice
against Andrea, Jenquese, and Wyamon, for the <i>goshons</i> of Capt. Adams
and the money they have receaved without lycense from me. And he gave
me faire wordes, and willed me to retorne to hym to morrow after
nowne, for that he was envited out to a frendes howse to a banket and
at instant ready to departe.</p>

<p>And we were envited to supper to Paulo Dono, our gunpouder man, where
we had good cheare, and many chambers and guns shott affe.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 22</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 10</i>).&mdash;I went againe to Gonrok Dono about my plito
with Andrea of Edo for the <i>goshons</i> of Capt. Adames children. But he
sent for the said Andrea, and, in my hearing, tould us both he would
not meddell in the matter, he being of Edo and I of Firando. Soe I
think Gonrok was grezed in the fist before hand.</p>

<p><!--134.png--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>
Also Cuemon of Nangasaque came before hym about our processe with Ed.
Sayer for the 100 <i class="measure">tais</i> he saieth he had not receved, although we
have his hand to shew for it. Soe Gonrock Dono entreated me to geve
hym 50 <i class="measure">tais</i>, because he was a pore man, and the matter in question
both before the King of Firando and hym selfe. I answerd I would be
ruled herin per his Lordshipp, but first desired the acco. might be
perused betwix the China Capt., for me, and let hym apoint an other
for hym selfe.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 23</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 11</i>).&mdash;I went and vizeted Feze Dono, the justis,
and carid hym 2 bottelles of strong waters, bottelles and all, which
he took in good parte and gave me greate thankes for it. Alsoe I sent
other two of same to Gonrok Dono, which he kindly accepted of. And I
gave the water of other 2 to Alvaro Gonsalves and Alferes Twerto.</p>

<p>Also I took up iij M. <i class="measure">tais</i> in plate of barrs this day of Tozayemon
Dono, our host of Sackay, at ij per cento per month, or else at his
coming to Firando to geve hym silke or other comodety in payment to
his content, or keepe the money for 5 months at intrest.</p>

<p>This day Hollands junck departed from Firando towardes Syam.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 24</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 12</i>).&mdash;The China Capt. sent away 16 China marrens
to Capt. Speck.</p>

<p>I left a letter with Alvaro Gonsalves for to deliver to Emanuel
Rodrigos when he returneth from Xaxma, of my coming hither only to
make plito against Capt. Adames men for delivering the two <i>goshons</i>
without making me privie to it; and that Jenque hath receved above
1000 <i class="measure">tais</i> of Capt. Adams money without making me privie to it nor
how it is disburced; and Wyamon Dono, an other of the deceased Capt.
Adams men, hath taken up 400 <i class="measure">tais</i> worth merchandiz of me, and meneth
to goe capt. of the <i>goshon</i> in his junck without making me payment;
and Torosacka, an other of
<!--135.png--><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>
Capt. Adams men, oweth Mr. Eaton 50 <i>ta</i>,
and meneth to goe offecer in his junck without making payment, which I
desire non of them may. As also that Mr. Eaton hath certen fyne corse
lynen, which he meanes to send to Manillias.</p>

<p>The China Capt. junck arived from Firando.</p>

<p>I receved a writing of Itamia Migel Dono to retorne me my <i>goshon</i> at

<i>Febrary 10 (Shiwas 29</i>).&mdash;Gonrok Dono came to vizet our English howse
and desired to see our lead, which I shewed unto hym; which he took in
good part, as also the entertaynment he hadd; and did promise to doe
his best to bring the price of the leade to 5 <i class="measure">tais pico</i>, yet,
because he had written to the contrary, could not now on the sudden
doe it. And he being ready to departe towardes themperours court, I
sent hym ij glasse bottelles of a pottell a peece filled with Spanish
wine, to drink in the way; which he took in very kind parte.</p>

<p>And the Hollandes junck being ready to departe, I went to Cochie, and

Hollanders had soe agreed with hym, I would know of them, and would
not obstenately replie noe. So it seemed this Gonrok plaid on both
partes, thinking his faire wordes would make fooles faine; for he
tould me he esteemed our parcell of lead much better then the
Hollanders, and to the Hollanders said he esteemed theirs much better
then ours.</p>

<p>Divers neighbors sent wyne and fish for presentes.</p>

ment to lett the price of the leade goe at 4&#189; <i class="measure">tais pico</i> or noe;

Speck denying it; and Gonrok Dono departed away towardes Miaco; and

doe, unto whome he sent, they being our neighbours and his secretary.
I made answer that his Lordshipps request was reasonable, and
therefore I was content, but must stay till our fleete came, to know
the quantety of each sort; and for the gunpolder I desired that Paule
Dono, our gunpolder man of Nangasaque, might have the oversight of the

<p>Also we agreed with Trebioye Dono, the <i>bongew</i> of the

China Capt., that he will not goe to the iland of Taccasanga this
yeare as lyers report; 1 from Harnando Ximenes, to like effect; 1 from
Pasquall Bonita.</p>

<p>Also Harnando Ximenes writes me that the Portingale ambassador is
retorned back to Edo per councell of Gonrok Dono, as it seemeth, to
get out a <i>goshon</i>, as also to plite against us for the friggat taken.</p>

<p><i class="day">Marche 6</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 23</i>).&mdash;Oyen Dono came to thenglish howse and
tould me how Semi Dono staid only for Taccamon Dono to make an end
about our demand both for howses and kaye seaward. So I sent Tome
Dono, our <i>jurebasso</i>, to Taccamon Dono, 4 leagues hence, to desire
his Lordshipp to hasten the matter, tyme passing on, and the shipps
would be heare shortly, and then could we doe nothing.</p>

<p><i class="day">Marche 7</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 24</i>).&mdash;We had xxviij barkes lading of stones.</p>

<p>And Tome Dono, our <i>jurebasso</i>, retorned from Taccamon Dono with
answer that, yf we had the one howse at 80 <i class="measure">taies</i>, he knew no reason
but we might have the other at same
<!--150.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>
price; and for the kay or wharfe,
he thought we might have it, and would write thereof to Semi Dono per
his man, hym selfe being busie about building his owne howse in the
cuntrey, as our <i>jurebasso</i> saw, he having above ijC. men at work,
and, as it is thought, determeneth to retire hym selfe to dwel in the
cuntrey and leave all to Seme Dono, whoe will be domenus factotum.
Taccamon Dono wrot me a letter he was content we should have both
howses and kay.</p>

<p><i class="day">Marche 8</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 25</i>).&mdash;Upon Taccamon Donos answer I wrot a
letter to Semi Dono that all but he were content we should have both
howses and key.</p>

<p>And there was 146 labourers and xj carpenters this day, with xviij
boates lading of stones.</p>

<p>And Semi Dono sent for our <i>jurebasso</i> and tould hym he was content to
let us have the howses and wharfe as well as other men; but as yet we
have nothing but wordes. Yet, as I perceve, the Hollanders stood out
in it that it was unfitt we should build soe far out into sea; yet
they have donne much more. Yet they will not be knowne to deale in
this matter; only Capt. Leonard tould me, yf men did fyll up the end
of the bay with building, then ther would be no place to grownd
junckes or small shiping to trym them upon. Yet ther is place enough
besides, as I tould hym.</p>

<p>Mr. Eaton departed this day for Nangasaque, and I sent per hym 3
letters of adviz, to goe for Manillias to our fleete, being all one

rezon for it.</p>

<p><i class="day">Marche 12</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 29</i>).&mdash;Semi Dono and Taccamon Dono sent each
of them a man to tell me they came to deliver the kay towards the sea
unto me, but it should be but ij <i>tattamis</i>; unto whome I made answer
that, yf it weare not iij, I would not take it but rather rest as we
weare and not breake our howse and spend ij or iij C. <i class="measure">taies</i> for
nothing. And withall I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to tell them that, yf they
gave us vj <i>tattamis</i> it weare far better for the harbor, as I would
prove, yf they pleased to understand me. But I know it is the hollow
harted Hollanders geve councell for dispite to disgrace us, as tyme

arivall, there fell debate ashore betwixt English and Duch marrenars.
Soe one Hollander was slane and divers others hurt, both English and
Duch, espetially 2 Englishmen. So the admerell called a councell,
where it was determined to seek out the murtherers or strife makers on
both partes, and to punish them with death or otherwais, according to
desert. Alsoe it was ordayned to begyn to unlade our shipps on Munday,
Mr. Cockram to be at Hollandes house to take acco. of all landed, and
Mr. Balke at English howse, to like effect; and duble lock to be put
on dores till the goodes be vallued and parted.</p>

councell that nether English nor Hollander should goe ashore with
weopens, to prevent quarreling, yet the Hollanders flocked on shore
with swordes and <i>cattans</i> and sett upon our unarmed men and slew one
and hurt divers others; and, as it is said, are alowed and sett one
per Comander Jonson, vizadmerall.</p>

arived at
Nangasaque from Amacon and had brought much silk and stuffes, and soe
he said he would goe from his bargen, notwithstanding he had geven us
a bill under his hand writing for performance.</p>

<p>The bill of Tozemon Donos to take our silk was made in such sort that
he might take but i <i class="measure">pico</i> of a sort, yf he would, for no quantety was
set downe, nether that he should take all. This was donne per
neglegence of Mr. Eaton, that trusted his boy and would not call for a
<i>jurebasso</i>.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 5</i> (<i class="day">Roquenguach 28</i>).&mdash;Jno. Yossen came to thenglish howse to
begg the life of the Hollander condemned for killing Mr. Avery, but
could not preveale.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 6</i> (<i class="day">Roquenguach 29</i>).&mdash;This day, before nowne, the Hollanders
did behead Jno. Johnson van Hamborg, for killing Mr. Avery, 5 or 6
English men standing by at doing theirof; they having first made the
man soe drunk that he could scarse stand on his legges, and soe cutt
affe his head within their owne howse.</p>

<p>We had news for certen this day that 2 galliotas were arived at
Nangasaque from Amacou, with silk and stuffes, and 2 others yet
without to enter.</p>

<p>Also Mr. Christofer Bogans had a letter from a Portugez at Nangasaque,
wherin he wrot hym a long cercomstance how well the men (espetially
the woamen) weare used that escaped out of the shipp <i class="shipname">Unicorne</i> in
China, when she was cast away; and with what pompe the woamen weare
receaved; with many other Portingall lies. Others also wrot that 14
China juncks, 6 Portingall friggottes, arived at Manillias after our
fleete was departed from thence, soe that now both silk wares and all

<p><i class="day">August 7</i> (<i class="day">Roquenguach 30</i>).&mdash;The <i class="shipname">Bulls</i> company wholy mutyned, and
36 of them came to Firando and deliverd a writing unto me, wherin they
demanded their 16th parte
<!--186.png--><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>
of priz goods. And, after, Capt. Adames,
admerall, wrote me to take one James Martin, a Scotsman, yf he came to
Firando, and lay hym in irons. This Scott is he which stured up the <i
class="shipname">Bulls</i> men to muteny, promising to perswade the <i>Moons</i> men to doe
the like and to follow them, &ldquo;because&rdquo; (said he) &ldquo;they sell away the
goods, and, yf yow suffer them to carry them away, yow shall never
have any thing&rdquo;.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 10</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 3</i>).&mdash;We had a jenerall counsell this day at
the English howse, both of English and Hollanders, where it was
ordayned that the Duch should carry the flag in the meane topp, as
admerall, this second voyage for Manillias, and the English as
vizadmerall. But Capt. Robt. Adams, admerall the former voyadg,
aledged he was free per meanes of a letter he brought out of England,
and soe ment to resigne his place to Capt. Chorles Cleavenger and
retorne for Jaccatra. Unto whome it was objected that, yf he shronke,
it was a bad precedent to make all the rest doe the like. Unto which
he replied that, rather then that should happen, he would goe meanest
man in the fleete; yet that he would not put out the flagg in the fore
topp for 3 or 4 daies space, and in the meane tyme would take adviz
what was best to doe. And soe Jno. Jonson was ordayned admerall, to
put out his flagg in the meane top to morrow; and that the Councell of
Defences ordenances should be read abord all the fleete to morow; and
a muster taken how many men their were, and soe to know each mans
opinion, what he would replie against these proceadinges.</p>

<p>Also it was brought in question at the same councell, tuching the
abuse of one &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;, master of the shipp <i class="shipname">Swan</i> and on of the
Councell of War, how he per force did enter per night into the 5th
junck taken, with som 40 or 50 men with weopens and close lantarns,
and, after the beating and misusing of the Englishmen which had
pocession,<!--187.png--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>
did pilledg and sett the junk on fire, leaveing the English
men in her to be burned, yf they hadd nott byn releeved. Unto which
Jno. Johnson, the admerall, replied that our men had used other abuses
to his men. Which, in the end, was remitted till they came to the
Councell of Defence at Jaccatra.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 11</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 4</i>).&mdash;This day Jno. Johnson was made admerall
both of Duch and English, and proclemation made abord each shipp, both
Duch and English, and all presoners sett at libertie for any muteny
hertofore, the Duch at request of Capt. Adams and the English at
request of Jno. Johnson, admerall.</p>

<p>China Capt. went to Nangasaque, and Andreas with hym, to bring about
the China Capt. junck, to carine our shipps by.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 12</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 5</i>).&mdash;Gonrok Dono passed by this place to
Nangasaque, and Capt. Leonard Camps and my selfe went to hym about
priz of our leade, and he, being ready to departe, willed us to follow
hym to Nangasaque.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 13</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 6</i>).&mdash;Capt. Robt. Adames, our late admerall
of the English and Duch fleete to the Manillias, now made vizadmerall,
called a councell of these following, viz.: Capt. Chorles Cleavengar,
Capt. Edmond Lennis, Mr. Jno. Munden, Mr. Arnold Browne, seamen;
Joseph Cockram, Wm. Eaton, Ric. Cocks, merchantes&mdash;wherein he desired
to be dismissed from going vizadmerall this second tyme to Manillas,
shewing a discharg from our Right Honble. Company in England, being
permitted to retorne for England per first shipp which came; yet, in
respect the Councell of Defence had now made a second chose of hym (he
striving to put it to Capt. Chorles Clevengar), yet we all in generall
put it upon hym, which he in the end condecended unto, to put out his
flagg in the fore tope to morrow morning.</p>

<p>Yt was agreed per us and the Hollanders that to morow morning Capt.
Speck and another Hollander, with Mr.

Cockram and my selfe, should
goe for Nangasaque to morow, to make an end about price of our lead,
as also to provide any thing wanting to geve to the Emperour and
Councell for presentes.</p>

how I paid xxv <i class="measure">tais</i> plate barrs to hym.</p>

<p>Within night Lansman the Duchman came to vizet me, for by day he durst
not, for feare of the excomunecation, telling me it was defended that
noe Roman Catholick might open their mouth to speak to us.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 19</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 12</i>).&mdash;We went to vizet Gonrok Dono with the
present nomenated yistarday, and he of hymselfe began to speake about
the price of the leade, telling us that the Councell thought iiij <i
class="measure">taies</i> per <i class="measure">pico</i> enough, and therefore he durst not presume to geve
more. Unto which
<!--190.png--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>
we answered that themperour might take it for
nothing, yf he pleased, yet we knew it was in his Lordshipps handes to
sett what price he pleased; and, seeing Ogosha Samma of famos memory
sett the price at vj <i class="measure">taies</i> per <i class="measure">pico</i>, to take all which came at
that price, and Shongo Samma his sonne, the Emperour that now is, did
conferme it, we hoped his Lordshipp would have consideration thereof,
and the rather, for that we hadd now byn driven affe a yeare and a
halfe, and could not make benefite of our good nor monies, but weare
forced to take up money at interest. And, to conclud, we tould him he
hym selfe did offer 4&#189; <i class="measure">taies</i> per <i class="measure">pico</i> the yeare past; yet it
seemed he did not remember the same. And soe, being late, we departed
and left it to his Lordshipps consideration till to morrow to think
better thereof.</p>

<p>And soe we went to Skidayen Dono, his secretary, and carid hym the
present nomenated before, desyring hym to put his master in mind to
end the acco. of lead.</p>

<p>Within night Nicolas Marin, an Italian and pilot to the Portugezes,
came to vizet me, because he durst nott doe it per day, and tould me
how all weare excomunecated that did ether buy or sell with thenglish
or Hollanders, or had any conversation with them, or did soe much as
put affe their hattes or salute them in the streetes.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 20</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 13</i>).&mdash;I wrot a letter to Mr. Eaton, and sent
it per Mangusque, Zazabra Donos servant, advizing how Gonrok offerd us
now but 4 <i class="measure">tais pico.</i> for our lead, as also of the difference betwixt
Gonrok with the Japon merchantes against the Portugezes, about the
quantety of silk com in the friggates, and how he makes <i>pancado</i>
of stuffes now as well as of silke. And I wished Mr. Eaton to sell away
our silk, yf possibly he could, for it is said there is neare j M.
<i class="measure">pico.</i> com in these friggots.</p>

<p>And we carid our presentes to Feze Dono and Yasimon Dono, as is noted
downe the 18th present, and desired them
<!--191.png--><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span>
to be a meanes to Gonrok
Dono to make an end of the price of the leade, or to tell as what we
should trust unto.</p>

<p>The Hollanders supped with us at China Capt. and have envited us to
dynner to their lodging to morow.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 21</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 14</i>).&mdash;We sent to Gonrok Dono to know his
answer at what price he would set our leade. Soe he replied he would
geve us 4&#189; <i class="measure">taies</i>, upon condition we would geve hym a bill of our
handes that, yf the Emperour and Councell weare not content to geve so
much, we should let it goe for lesse. Unto which both the Hollanders
and we answerd that we would com to a sett price, were it at 4&#189; or
otherwais; the which he took in such snuffe as he sent our present
back againe to Hollandes lodging.</p>

<p>And I delivered an other letter to Yasobro, Tayemon Donos wives
brothers servant, advising how Gonrok Dono had retorned a flatt answer
he would geve but 4 <i class="measure">taies</i> per <i class="measure">pico</i> for lead, as also of arivall of
the junck from Manillia wherein Wyamon Dono went capt., and that all
was lies of 14 junckes and 6 friggats which arived after our fleete
came away.</p>

<p>This after nowne the junck, wherein Wyamon Dono went for Manillia with
Capt. Adams <i>goshon</i>, is now retorned to Faconda roade, and Migell com
ashore with news they have made a very badd voyage, and that they were
badly used per the Spaniardes, miscalling them because they were
frendes to the English and Duch. They also report that, after our
fleete came from Manillias, noe junckes entred theare [with exception]
of only 3 emptie ons which our fleet set at libertie, haveing rifeled
them; as also ij friggates arived theare and went in on the back side
of Manillias for feare of our fleete.</p>

<i class="day">August 23</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 16</i>).&mdash;I wrot a letter to Mr. Eaton and rest,
how we could not agree with Gonrok Dono about our lead, with other
occurrantes; but, after, we came to agreement at 4&#189; <i>cattis pico</i>
lead.</p>

<p>Manillia junck of Wyamon Dono arived at Nangasaque; and they report
that all Japons must be banished out of Manillias and non traffick
theare hearafter.</p>

leaves of Gonrok Dono and would have left the present with Skidayen
Dono, his secretary, but he would not receve it, telling us Gonrok
would be at Firando before it weare long, and then might we better
present it theare. Also Gonrok tould us he would send men to Firando
to way out the lead and pay our money theare forthwith.</p>

<p>And soe, towardes night, the Hollanders departed towardes Firando on a

<p>And we went to Setto to bed, wind being contrary, and staid all night;
and paid charges 1 <i class="measure">ta.</i>, and to his ij childron that brought
present of fish and pompians 2 <i>mas</i>.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 27</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 20</i>).&mdash;About midnight we arived at Firando,
where we found a Duch shipp <i>Amsterdam</i> entred, she coming in on the
north side of the iland, and was driven to Nanguay in Crates; and
there the Hollanders falling at debate with the Japons of Crates, they
fell together by the eares on shore, and 1 Hollander was kild and
divers others hurt, and the Japons went not skot free.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 28</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 21</i>).&mdash;The King of Firando arived heare this
day at nowne from the cort of Edo; and we went out in a boate and met
hym, as the Duch did the like, and they shott affe store of ordinance
both from howse and abord shipps; but all our ordinance weare ashore,
the shipps being on carine, soe I sent Mr. Cockram with a <i>jurebasso</i>
to bidd his Highnesse welcom, and to exckews the not shouting
ordinance, which he took in good parte as well as yf we had shott.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 29</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 22</i>).&mdash;I receved a bill from Tozemon Dono for

<p>And I rec. a letter from the domine of the Duch ship <i>Amsterdam</i>,

Nicolas, agent; wherin he doth write of the indirect dealing of the
Hollanders against our honble. emploiers.</p>

Jno. Neve, purcer of the shipp <i class="shipname">Moone</i>, for shipps use, viz. 330
peces browne cangas, 70 peces light blews.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 30</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 23</i>).&mdash;We went to vizet the King
<!--194.png--><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span>
of Firando,
both we and the Hollanders, and carid hym a present of ij <i>barricos</i>
of Spanish wine, &#189; a <i class="measure">pico</i> of cloves, and &#189; a <i class="measure">pico</i> of peper.
The wine he took, but the rest he refused. He urged very much to have
Capt. Speck to goe to Edo this yeare, in respect he was well knowne to
themperour and his Councell, as also thenglish had need to send one
that knew the orders of Japan, for that we had many enemis at Court
per means of the Portingales and Spaniardes and their well willars
which weare many. Unto which we answerd that we would take councell
about the matter and have in remembrance what his Highnesse had made
knowne unto us.</p>

<p>We envited the Hollanders admerall, merchantes, and all the rest of
princepalles to dyner after to morow, being Sattarday; but the
admerall, Wm. Johnson, denied.</p>

<p><i class="day">August 31</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 24</i>).&mdash;Tonoman Samma, the kinges brother,
sent for Capt. Camps and me in all hast, to speake with hym; which we
did; and was to put us in mynd both from the king his brother as also
of hymselfe that, at any hand, we should keep Capt. Speck heare this
yeare to goe up to Edo to themperour, as also to be a meanes to end
other [things].</p>

<p><i class="day">September 1</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 25</i>).&mdash;Wm. Johnson, thadmerall, with all
the cheefe of the Hollanders, came to dynner this day, and supped with
us likewies. And we hadd the <i>caboques</i> after dynner.</p>

<p>And Unagense Dono sent me ij <i>catabras</i> for a present, i of silke,
and the other lynen cloth.</p>

<p>Also the justis, Taccamon Dono, sent us word to geve over making
<i>gallegalle</i><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span>
in our howse we hired of China Capt., because
the white lyme did trowble the player or singing man, next neighbour. Soe
we were forced to doe it, notwithstanding it cost us xx <i class="measure">taies</i> to
build that howse, and soe to make and hier a new one in an other place.</p>

<p><!--195.png--><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>
The report is that Bonga Dono is dead, and that he died the day before
the kinges arivall; and yett it is not published till the feasting be

 Hindustani: <i>galgal</i>, mortar made of lime and linseed oil.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 2</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 26</i>).&mdash;The king sent to Semi Dono to
signefie unto hym my answer tuching Capt. Speck, that I agreed with
hym that it was fitting he should stay this yeare, and goe for Edo
about these busynes. Soe Semi Dono sent me word to contynew in that
opinion, for that it was good and profitable to both companis.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 3</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 27</i>).&mdash;A Portugez, called Ranelles, came
from Nangasaque, offering his service to goe in our fleete, telling me
that Lopas Sermiente Caravalle, the new capt. more, had misused hym
without occation; yet I suspect him to be a spie sent to see what we
doe.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 4</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 28</i>).&mdash;We went to the king, being sent for,
both the Hollanders and us, where he made known to us a writing sent
from themperor and his Councell, that no stranger should buy any
slaves, ether men or woamen, to send them out of the cuntrey, nether
carry out any armor, <i>cattans</i>, lances, <i>langanantes</i>, poulder or
shott, or guns; nether any Japon marrenars to goe in our shipping.</p>

<p>And we were envited to dyner abord the Duch shipp <i>Amsterdam</i>, where
we wanted no drink.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 5</i> (<i class="day">Sitinguach 29</i>).&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to Cochie to
know wherefore the kinges <i>bongew</i> would not permitt our tymber and
boardes to be landed at our howse, as also what he ment to take ij of
our men presoners upon no occation. And he retorned me answer, he did
not forbid the landing of our tymber, but only gave his men charge
(per order from the king) to serch all the barks which came into
Cochie, for to see whether they brought any armor, weapons, or
munition (thinges defended per the Emperour), which might be brought
in boates under tymber
<!--196.png--><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>
or boardes as well as otherwais. And tuching
our two men, the one being charged with stealing of a knife, as he
confesseth, but the Japans burthen hym with stealing of money, and the
other for the bad handling of a woaman great with child, whereby she
cast her child; &ldquo;yet&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;I make acco., yf yow speake but one
word to Semi Dono, he will sett them free&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Also oure marenars of the shipp <i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i> through their neglegence
sett a hodd of stuffe or pitch on fire, which had like to have burned
all our howsing and the towne of Cochie, and burned us som 50 trees or
rownd tymbers of 2, 3, and 4 <i class="measure">tais</i> per peece.</p>

<p>And I sent the <i>caboques</i> ij barrs plate, containing vij <i class="measure">taies</i>, for
playing when the Hollanders weare heare.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 6</i> (<i class="day">Fatinguach 1</i>).&mdash;I paid to the <i>maky</i> man, Canzemon

<p><i class="day">September 7</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 2</i>).&mdash;I went to Semi Dono, Mr. Cockram
and Mr. Bogens accompanying me, to desire hym our ij Englishmen might
be sett at libertie, which they comanded us to keepe in preson, we
having greate occation to use them in our shiping this faire wether,
and that they were accused of mier mallice, becase a Japon was taking
of suspition for killing an Englishman; but, for that Japon, we left
it to his Lo. pleasure to make ferther proofe, as he pleaced, for that
we could say noe more then we hadd
<!--197.png--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 193]</span>
donne. Also I desired that we
might be discharged of the Japon theefe we tooke stealing the hoopes
of iron affe our cask; unto which he answered we weare best to make
the matter knowne unto Tonomon Dono, unto whome he was ready then to
goe, and to sett all downe in writing; which we did.</p>

<p>The one side of the <i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i> was wholie sheathed this day from the
keele to the bend.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 8</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 3</i>).&mdash;I rec. a letter from Gonrok Dono to
way out the lead to his men per whome he sent the letter.</p>

<p>I delivered into the factory, for presentes for themperour, 72
<i>cattis</i> white twisted silk at 220 <i class="measure">tais pico</i>, 158:&nbsp;4:&nbsp;0; 59 <i>cattis</i>
white pole or Lankin silk at 285 <i class="measure">ta. pico</i>, 168:&nbsp;1:&nbsp;5.</p>

<p>Gonrok Donos men, with the King of Firandos <i>bongews</i>, came to look on
our lead; and on Munday morning will begin to way.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 9</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 4</i>).&mdash;At nowne the king sent for me in
all hast to com to hym; which I did, accompanied with Mr. Edward
Sayer; where we fownd he had prepared a <i>jurebasso</i> which spoake
Spanish. The reason he tould me was, for that he dowbted our other
<i>jurebassos</i> did not well understand what he had formerly said, in
respeckt we had not resolved hym in all this tyme whether we
determened to keepe Capt. Speck this yeare to goe for Edo with others
of our nation which knew the order of Japon and were knowne to
themperour and his Councell, but to the contrary lett the Spaniardes
and Portingales goe before us, whoe were our enemies, as all the
merchants of Nangasaque and Miaco were the like, soe that we had no
frend soe sure in Japon to trust unto as he was; and, yf we would not
beleeve his councell, we might doe as we list, for the falt was not in
hym. Unto which I made answer his Highnes had reason, but that I was
not in falt; and that he might
<!--198.png--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>
know, yf it pleaced hym to let his
<i>jurebasso</i> goe with me to the Hollandes howse to heare their answer.
Which he was contented, and withall bad me tell the Duch admerall,
with Capt. Camps and Capt. Speck, that, yf Capt. Speck staid not
heare, he held them all 3 for enemies to the English and Hollands
affares. The which I made knowne to the admerall Johnson, Capt. Camps,
Capt. Speck, and the rest; but it seemed they 2 former made light of
it, yet answerd they would call a generall councell to morow and speak
of that and other matters. The which I certefid the king of per the
said <i>jurebasso</i>, Nicolas Martin.</p>

<p>Also our ij men which were in preson were now sett at libertie. Yet
thadmerall, Capt. Adames, sent them abord the ship <i class="shipname">Moone</i>, to geve
them exemplary punishment, because they might remember it another
tyme; for out of dowbt som abuse their was, otherwais the Japons would
not have laid handes on them.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 10</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 5</i>).&mdash;We had a generall councell this
day at Duch howse, where it was concluded that 10 shipps this yeare
shall procead againe to the Manillias, to be ready to departe by the
xxth of November next, ould stile. But that ij of them shall goe out
before, within this 15 or 20 daies, viz. the <i class="shipname">Bull</i> and the <i class="shipname">Moyen</i>,
to stay upon the coast of China to look out for junckes, till the
other 8 com after to the place apointed them to stay; but yf, in the
meane tyme, stormie wether drive them away, then to meete them at
Manillias, at a place apointed and tyme.</p>

<p>Also it was debated to have Capt. Speck stay this yeare and goe for
Edo as the king desired. But the Duch admerall, Capt. Camps, Capt.
Lefevre, and the rest would not consent thereunto, saying it la not in
their power to doe it, he being sent for by their presedent and
generall at Jaccatra; but Capt. Speck spoke openly that the Hollanders
gave it out that this was a formed matter made betwixt the
<!--199.png--><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span>
King of
Firando, Capt. Speck, and my selfe, to have hym stay heare an other
yeare, without any occation or need at all. Which for my parte I
protest before God they doe bely me; for I did speake to have hym to
stay heare only to content the King of Firando, and for nothing else,
because he was soe important with me and others about it. Soe there
was nothing donne about going up to themperour. Of the which I advized
the King of Firando what the Hollanders answer was, which gave hym
small content, for he answerd that we should find his wordes true,
that he gave us good councell, and that it would be to late hereafter
to amend it, and therefore we should not empute the falt his.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 11</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 6</i>).&mdash;We began to way out our lead this
day per single <i>piculls</i>, and geve in each <i class="measure">pico.</i> a <i>catty</i>.</p>

<p>And it should seeme the king being discontent because Capt. Speck
stayeth not in Japon this yeare, for he sent to the Hollandes howse to
seeke for pikes that were made ready to send for Jaccatra and weare
carid abord a shipp. But the king comanded they should be brought
ashore againe, although Capt. Camps aledged they were bought the yeare
past, before themperours edict came out; yet that would not serve, but
they must be unladed againe.</p>

<p>Also it seemed he was angry with us, for he gave order that our
laborers, which wrought about carining our shipps, should geve over
work, and banished a Japon of Nangasaque which we had entertayned to
be overseer of the work. But at my request our laborars were permitted
to work as before.</p>

<p>And we waied out 92 <i class="measure">pico.</i> lead this day to themperours <i>bongews</i>.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 12</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 7</i>).&mdash;One of the <i>Eliza.</i> men, called Gabrell
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;, a plot maker, being drunk, fell overbord and was
drowned.</p>

<p>The King sent Torazemon Dono and other ij of his noble
<!--200.png--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>
men to tell me
he was enformed that, at my being at Nangasaque, I had bought a greate
quantety of gunpouder, to be secretly conved abord our shipps at
Cochie, under culler of other matters. Unto which I answered, I had
bought non, nether did ever speake word to any man about it, as before
God I did not. Soe it seemed they were content with my answer, and
promised me to relate the truth to the king and to get Jacobe Dono,
our boteswaine, released, he being banished, per order from the king,
by the spitfull dealinges of the <i>bongews</i> at Cochie.</p>

<p>I went to the Duch howse with Mr. Cochram to know wherefore they were
noe forwarder in sending up to themperour; and Capt. Camps tould me
the comander Johnson held matters back.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 13</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 8</i>).&mdash;We had much a doe with the
<i>bongews</i> which waid out our lead, we having waid out above 800
<i class="measure">pico.</i> these 3 daies past, they leving it still in our howse, not
carying any away, soe that now all our void howsroome was full; and
they would have me emptie our shipp provition out of our store roome
to geve them place, which I tould them I would not doe.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 14</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 9</i>).&mdash;We had a generall councell this
day, wherin we protested against Wm. Johnson, admerall, yf he sent
away Capt. Speck, the King of Firando being soe ernest to stay hym
heare to goe to Edo, in default whereof wee all protested against hym
and his partakers, yf in case any hinderance or domage did happen to
either Company, and sent it to the Duch howse per Mr. Eaton, Joseph
Cockram, Mr. Ed. Sayer, and Mr. Nicolas Bogens, who heard it read in
presence of the said Wm. Johnson, admerall, Capt. Lefevre, and Capt.
Camps, with others; but Jonsons answer was that it was ordayned per a
generall councell that Capt. Speck must goe for Jaccatra in the
<i class="shipname">Sunne</i>, and goe he should.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 15</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 10</i>).&mdash;I went to the king,
<!--201.png--><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 197]</span>
accompanied
with Mr. Eaton and Mr. Cockram, to signefie the protest we had made
against the Duch admerall, Wm. Johnson, for not staying Capt. Speck
this yeare in Firando; the which the king said was well donne and
desired a coppie thereof and tould us, seeing the Hollanders made soe
light a reconyng therof, he would perforce stay Capt. Speck heare till
he had order from the Emperours court (or councell) whether he should
stay or goe, and would forthwith send an expres to know their honors
pleasure therein; and in the meane tyme wished us to send up som
others with the present to themperour and councell, and that I should
stay heare with Capt. Speck to take councell about the disposing of
the friggat when Gonrok Dono came.</p>

<p>And soone after the king sent for Capt. Camps, asking hym, as he did
me, what was concluded about Capt. Speck staying. Unto which he made
answer that he and the rest of the merchant[s] had donne what they
could, but that the comander, Wm. Johnson, would not permit it; and
that now Capt. Speck answerd he would not stay upon any termes, but
procead for Jaccatra, and soe he sent word to the king. Soe he,
perceving how matters went, tould Capt. Camps he could not goe up to
themperour till he had made an end about the friggat and we proved the
Jesuistes to be padres or mas pristes, as they terme them, and that
could not be donne till Gonrok Dono came from Nangasaque; yet in the
meane tyme we might embale up our presentes and send ij yong men
before with them to shew our obedience to themperour, and I and Capt.
Camps follow after when the other busynes was donne.</p>

<p>And Albartus came after to the English howse and tould me that in 3
generall councells amongst them selves the most voyces had confermed
Capt. Jacob Specks to stay in Japon this yeare, but Johnson, the
comander, bakt all.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 16</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 11</i>).&mdash;We had a comunion
<!--202.png--><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>
this day at
English howse adminestered per Mr. Arthur Hatch, prechar of the ship
<i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i>.</p>

<p>Also an Englishman, one of the <i class="shipname">Pepercorns</i> companie, named Wm.
Barker, having layne on shore 3 wicks, never going abord to look to
ships busines, and being drunk yistarday in a carpentars howse would
have layne with a woaman per force, and against her will took 4 rings
of silvar of her fingars, and drunk 2 <i>ma </i> or xij <i>d.</i> in wine, and
in the end would have gon away and pay nothing and carry the rings
along with hym; and, because the good wife of the howse laid handes on
hym, he did beate her. Whereupon the neighbors coming upon hym did
bynd hym, and sent me word therof; and I, going to the howse, fownd
the rings in his pocket, which I restored back againe and made hym pay
the ij <i>mas</i>, and brought hym to thenglish howse, where, at the
whiping post, he had first 60 lashes with a whipp, and then washed in
brine, and, after, 40 more lashes.</p>

<p>And after nowne one Beedam, a master mate of the shipp <i class="shipname">Elizabeth</i>,
being drunk, did fall out of the shipps sterne over the reales, 5
fathom hie, and fell into a junck at her side, where he broke his
skull, and is meamed in one legg and an arme and in danger to die.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 17</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 12</i>).&mdash;I sould Mr. Munden a rapiar and
daggar for 48 R. 8, with gerdell and hangers all plated over with
silver.</p>

<p>The Hollandes shipp, called the <i>New Sealand</i>, arived at Firando in
Cochie roade toward night.</p>

<p>And we waid out 460 <i class="measure">pico.</i> of lead this day.</p>

<p>And Mr. Eaton, Mr. Osterwick, and my selfe went to the Duch howse,
and, with Capt. Camps, sett downe the presentes to be geven to
themperour and his nobillety, littell more or lesse then it was the
last yeare; as also we had speeches whether it weare fitting to geve
themperours sonne a present, he being at mans estate, and we by
frendes
<!--203.png--><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span>
at court put in mynd thereof. Soe we concluded to put in
Japon writing the presentes we ment to geve this yeare, and to ask the
King of Firandos councell whether he thought good to have us to add or
deminish any thing therein, as also whether we should geve a present
to the yong prince, themperours sonne, or any other his Highnesse
thought fitting.</p>

<p>We rec. 5000 <i class="measure">taies</i> in bar plate, per Gonrok Donos apointment, for
lead.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 18</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 13</i>).&mdash;I gave a letter of favor to
Vincent Roman, allius Lansman, for Camboja, dated this day. He is a
Duch man, our frend.</p>

<p>The king sent to tell me that Gonrok Dono had sent a letter in favor
of the capt. more of the Portingales for 3 laskaros which were run
away and abord the Hollanders or us, to have them retorne againe. Unto
which I answerd I knew nothing of any such matter, for I had non in
thenglish howse, yet I would enquere yf ther weare any abord shipp,
and send his Highnesse word.</p>

<p>Also there was a councell to know whether Peter Wadden should goe for
Jaccatra or remeane in the fleet.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 19</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 14</i>).&mdash;I paid j M. j C. <i class="measure">tais</i> plate
bars unto Cushcron Dono, wherof 1099 <i class="measure">ta.</i> 7 <i class="measure">m.</i> 4 <i>co.</i> is in full
payment of the fleetes provition the last yeare.</p>

<p>Ould Nobisane, called Bongo Dono, died ij daies past, which was said
to dy before the king arived.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 20</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 15</i>).&mdash;The king sent order that we and
the Hollanders should meete this day at Torazemon Donos to confer
about going up to Edo, and that the admerall Johnson should com with
us; but he denid to goe and drove it affe till night, yet then sent
word he would goe in the mornyng.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 21</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 16</i>).&mdash;Wm. Johnson, the Duch admerall,
with Capt. Camps, Mr. Ballok, Duchmen, and Capt. Robt. Adams, our
admerall, Mr. Osterwick, and my
<!--204.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span>
selfe went to the howse of Torazemon
Dono, where we fownd 3 or 4 more of the kinges councell, whoe tould us
we had need to look well to our witnesses to prove the frires in
preson at Holands howse to be padres; otherwaies our processe of the
friggat would be lost, for that Gonrok Dono took their partes against
us, soe that we must have other witnesses then our selves; for
allthough all our fleet said it was soe, yet our owne witnesse would
not be taken. Also they tould us we ought to enlardg our presentes to
the Emperor and councell, having such intricate matters in hand, and
that, for a present to the yong prince (themperours sonne), we might
take councell when we weare above whether it weare fytt to doe it or
noe, according as we saw our busynes goe forward.</p>

<p>Also they said the king desired that the next yeare, when our shiping
came, that we would lett all stay at Cochie and non enter into
Firando. Unto which we made answer that, seeing our howsing was made
at Firando, we desired that 5 or 6 shipps might each yeare enter into
Firando. Unto which they replied that then we ought to cleare the
harbor of the wreck cast away the other yeare, otherwais, yf any other
should miscarry, it would quite spoile his harbor that noe bark nor
shiping could ever enter into it. So they left us to consider of the
matter, the Hollanders saying that their shipp was cast away by
falling fowle of the <i class="shipname">James Royalls</i> cable, and therefore that it was
reason we paid halfe.</p>

<p>Also they shewed a letter from Gonrok Dono, wherin he wrot the <i class="title">Tono</i>
of Firando to stay Capt. Speck till the processe of the friggot was
ended; but the admerall Johnson nor Capt. Speck would not consent to
it.</p>

<p>And I receved a letter from the Molucas from Mr. Wm. Nicoles, dated in
Mallayo the 9th of August, and sent per the shipp <i>Sealand</i>.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 23</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 18</i>).&mdash;This night our gunpouder howse,
where we dryd our pouder, was beset with
<!--205.png--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span>
men to have donne som
mischeefe, as we thought; but, being espied, they fled and had a boate
ready to convay them away. There was 5 of them seene neare unto the
howse, and one of our men which were at watch thrust at one of them
with a short pike, which the other caught by the iron head, and it
being badly nealed he puld it affe and carid it away with hym, and soe
fled with the rest, as afore said. Soe we esteeme they were sett on by
the Spaniardes and Portingales to have blowne up all our gunpouder, to
have overthrowne our voyadge, knowing themperour will suffer us to by
nor carry out non.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 24</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 19</i>).&mdash;There was 465 <i class="measure">pico.</i> lead waid
out this day.</p>

<p>I went to Torazemon Dono, the kinges secretary, and tould hym of the
pretence of blowing up our gunpouder howse, which I and the rest
suspected was per instigation of Spaniard and Portingales; the which
he wondered at, and tould me he would make it knowne to the king.</p>

<p>And, after, we were enformed that Lues Martin and other 2 Portingales
departed from Firando late yisternight, after daylight donne, and went
with their boate into the cod of the bay neare to our gunpouder howse,
to have seene the sport of blowing up the howse; but, the matter being
discovered, they made hast away, and the villens set on to doe it did
escape in an other boate for Firando, som of which we hope to find
out.</p>

<p>This night, after midnight, the dead corps of Bongo Samma was carid to
be burned, or rather a peece of wood in place, for he was thought to
be a Christian. All the nobilletye with a multetude of other people
did follow the hearce. The cheefe mornar was a woaman, all in white,
with her haire hanging downe her back and her face covered, and a
strange attire upon her head like a rownd stoole. All the <i>Boses</i>
(or pagon pristes) went before the herse with great lightes, and the
nobillety followed after,<!--206.png--><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]</span>
all in generall with such silence that noe
words weare spoaken; and they kneeled downe in divers places, as
though they had praid, but not one word heard what they said. And in
many places they threw abrod <i>cashes</i> (or brasse money) in great
quantety, and in the end most of all at the place where he was burned,
that the people might take it, as they did allso much white lynen
cloth which compased in a fowre square place where the herse was
burned. And there was one <i>bose</i>, or prist, hanged hym selfe in a tree
hard by the place of funerall, to accompany hym in an other world, for
<i>boses</i> may not cutt their bellies, but hang them selves they may. And
3 other of the dead mans servantes would have cut their bellies, to
have accompanid hym to serve hym in an other world, as they stidfastly
beleeve they might have donne; but the king would not suffer them to
doe it. Many others, his frendes, cut affe the 2 foremost joyntes of
their littell fingers and threw them into the fire to be burned with
the corps, thinking it a greate honor to them selves and the least
service they could doe to hym, soe deare a frend and greate a
personage, for he was brother to Foyne Samma, grandfather to the King
Figen a Came, that now is. And he hath adopted Gentero Samma, the
kinges brother, for his lawfull sonne, becase he had no children of
his owne, and hath left all he hath to hym, he being the kinges pledg
at Edo.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 25</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 20</i>).&mdash;I went to Torazemon Dono, the
kinges secretary, and tould hym we had found out the theefe which
pulled affe the pike head and 2 other of his consortes, desiring hym
to speake to the king that we might have justice against them, and
that they might be constrayned to tell whoe sett them on to have
blowne up our gunpouder; the which he promised me to do. But first he
would examen our witnesses that had brought to light those 3 men,
which were the <i>bongew</i> and neighbors of
<!--207.png--><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span>
the villadge neare the
gunpouder howse, whoe fownd them out and made it knowne unto me and
others.</p>

<p>Also Semi Dono sent for our <i>jurebasso</i> and the Holland <i>jurebasso</i>
and bid them tell us (as from the kinge) that both we and the
Hollanders should geve in our answer to morrow at nowne tuching the
geting the wrackt shipp out of the harbour, for that the king would
not suffer any of our shiping to enter till that weare taken out of
the roade.</p>

<p>Also, the <i class="shipname">Bull</i> riding by the <i class="shipname">Pepercorns</i> side, to helpe to carine
her, as she had donne the like to the <i class="shipname">Bull</i> before, and a planke
going from one shipp to the other, as Mr. Munden was going over, a
leawd fello of the <i class="shipname">Pepercorns</i> company hive up the plank with his
shoulder and threw hym affe betwixt the 2 shipps, which lying soe
close together, he could not falle into the sea, which yf he had, he
had byn drowned without remedy; yet he was sore brused with the falle.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 26</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 21</i>).&mdash;We had a generall councell of
English and Duch at Hollandes howse about taxing or prising the 2
shipps <i class="shipname">Pepercorns</i> and <i class="shipname">Muyon</i>, but could not agree upon prise of the
shipps hulls, mastes, and tackling, we seting the <i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i> at 300
tons, and the tonne at 5 <i>l.</i>, is 1500 <i>l.</i> str.; and the Duch would
have rated the <i class="shipname">Muyon</i> at 2000 <i>l.</i> str., being a lesser shipp then
ours, they alledging she was newer. Soe that is referd to the Councell
of Defence at Jaccatra.</p>

<p>Also it was spoaken of to have us to joyne with the Hollanders in
purce, to help to gett the shipp that was wracked the last yeare out
of the harbour of Firando, the king comanding us so to doe. Unto which
we answered that she belonged to the Duch and was non of the shipps of
defence, and therefore we had noe reason to be at charg of money to
get her out. Yet we offerd them before, when we had leasure, since the
arivall of the fleete, to lett 2 or 300 of our men helpe them to get
her out; but then they made light of it. Yet, notwithstanding, to geve
the King of Firando
<!--208.png--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>
content, I said that, yf the Duch would agree
with the Japons to rydd the havon of her, I was content to sett my
hand to a writing to be contributary to som part of the charge, with
condition it should be left to the precedentes at Jaccatra to determen
whether it was fitt we should pay any thing or noe; and, in the meane
tyme, the Duch to disburse all the charges.</p>

<p>We are geven to understand that Ric. Short and other Englishmen are
run away to the enemy at Nangasaque.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 29</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 24</i>).&mdash;I wrote 2 letters to Nangasaque,
one to Yasimon Dono, Gonrok Donos clark, and the other to Andrea
Dittis, China Capt., to use their best endevour to seek out for Ric.
Short and the rest of the English runawaies, espetially Short that is
a witnesse against the frires in the Duch howse and hath seene one of
them say mas at Nangasaque, and was enticed 4 or 5 daies past per
Francisco Lopas and 2 Portingall frires to run away. The King of
Firando sent a man of his with letters to Gonrok Dono to same effect.</p>

<p><i class="day">September 30</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 25</i>).&mdash;We went to Holland howse to

<p><i class="day">October 1</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 26</i>).&mdash;Alvaro Munos came to Firando and
tells me Ric. Short was staied at Nangasaque, at his first arivall,
for a padre, but after released, when they knew whoe he was.</p>

<p>Capt. Lafevre was beaten and drubed per the rascall Japon laborers of
Firando, because he landed at kinges steares; but, as it is said, the
king hath taken the doers thereof and will put som of them to death;
but I doe not beleeve it.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 2</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 27</i>).&mdash;I paid xxiiij <i class="measure">tais</i> plate barrs to

the runawais with speed, overtook them and kept them from proceading
forward, till Mr. Sayer came after. Soe they brought back vj men

And the master of the bark which carid them away is taken presoner,
with an other Japon of Nangasaque that entised them to run away; and
the King of Firando will put them both to death, as it is reported.</p>

<p>And I deliverd my letters to Capt. Speck this day to carry for
Jaccatra and England.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 4</i> (<i class="day">Fatchinguach 29</i>).&mdash;I wrot 2 letters by the shipp

should pay for the iron wedges and smiths labour for cutting the lead.
Unto which we answerd, his <i>bongews</i> had the just acco. of the <i class="measure">pico.</i>
waid out; and for the iron wedges (as we formerly promised) we were
content to pay, they being left to us when the work was finished; but
for the laborers which wroght, Gonrok was to pay them.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 6</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 2</i>).&mdash;The shipp <i class="shipname">Swan</i> put to sea this day in
the after nowne, and I went abord with the rest of the merchantes to
bidd hym farewell; and, as it seemed, the admerall Johnson did geve
hym a churlish farewell, according to his borishe condition.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 7</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 3</i>).&mdash;I delivered or gave a recept to King of

<p><i class="day">October 8</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 4</i>).&mdash;This day weare arayned vj English
runawais, most of them being duble runawais and som fellons, and
therefore, by generall consent, according to marshall law, condemned
all to be hanged, 3 of them being of the <i class="shipname">Bulles</i> men and the other 3
of the <i class="shipname">Pepercorns</i> men, as doth apere the 3th day of this mo. of
October, when they weare retorned. And one James Martyn, accused by
som to be the author of this mischeefe, he being a Scotsman, and fownd
to be a cheefe bellows blower or sterrer up of all mutanies
heretofore. Soe the admerall, Robt. Adames, sent a comition out to
aprehend hym and bring hym ashore and soe put hym in preson to answer
for hym selfe.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 9</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 5</i>).&mdash;Yistarnight I was enformed that Francisco
Lopas and a semenary prist were com to towne, and lodged in the howse
of the capt. of the friggot taken the last yeare; of which I advised
Torezemon Dono to tell the king thereof by Coa Jno., our <i>jurebasso</i>,
it being late, and to geve order noe strangers should passe out. And
this morning I sent the same <i>jurebasso</i> to Torezemon Dono secretary,
to know the kinges answere; which was, I might speake of these matters
when Gonrok Dono came. Unto which I sent answer, it might be that then
these pristes would be gon, and then it was to late to speake. Yet,
for all this, there was noe eare nor respect geven to my speeches.</p>

<p>The admerall Capt. Adames, with all the comanders and merchants,
saving my selfe and Mr. Osterwick, went to Cochie to see the execution
of the condemd men. And 4 of them were executed, viz. Edward Harris,
boteswaine.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span></p>

<!--212.png--><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span>
day
without satisfying me for my serne of mase. This villen did lye heare
to entice our men to run away; but now per the <i class="title">tono</i> is comanded out
of towne.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 12</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 8</i>).&mdash;Taccamon Dono sent for me, he being
accompanid with Torazemon Dono, and Mr. Osterwick with me. They
enquered of me about the padres I said were in the capt. of the
friggates lodging, and sent for his host to know whether any such
people were in the howse; which he denied. Yet asked me whether I did
know them for padres, yf I did see them. Unto whome I answered that,
yf he brought them out, I had wittnesses which knew them well.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 13</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 9</i>).&mdash;Yasimon Dono, Gonrok Donos clark, being
ready to goe up to Miaco and soe for Edo with the lead for themperour,
I went and vizeted hym, and carid hym a pottell of strong annis water
distilled with musk, which he took in good parte, and lefte the
company where he was and came into an other roome with me; which som
others took in dogen and used som wordes about it. But this was a
fello, a spie sent per the fathers to pick quarrells against us. Yet I
said littell to it, but gave place, the others saying they staid for
Yasimon.</p>

<p>And this day, in the after nowne, the admerall Johnson, with Capt.
Speck and Capt. Lafevere, came to our howse to know whether our shipp
<i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i> were ready to goe out or noe, as theirs was; for that
tyme passed and our enemies were ready to gett tyme upon us, and that
their shipp, the <i class="shipname">Muyon</i>, was ready according to composition. Unto
which our comander, Robt. Addams, with the rest of us, answerd that
our shipp was as ready as theirs, and that on Twesday next should be
ready to set seale.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 14</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 10</i>).&mdash;I advized Mr. Sayer, at Nangasaque, to
look out for Short, costa que costa, and to speake to [contractors] to
send all away per first, for that our fleet would all be ready to
departe within 20 daies after
<!--213.png--><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span>
date hereof, and that the <i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i>
and <i class="shipname">Muyon</i> were now ready to departe; as also to send noe more barly
at above 8 <i>gantas</i> per <i class="measure">mas</i>.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 16</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 12</i>).&mdash;Mr. Sayer wrot me that, a friggat going
out, they serched her to the verry keele and opened all chistes, to
have fownd Ric. Short, but could not be fownd. [They fownd] above 1000
pikes, <i>langenott</i>, and <i>cattans</i>, and brought them back, and would
have staid the pilot; but the capt. more standes bound to answer for
all which is taken.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 17</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 13</i>).&mdash;I wrot out 2 remembrances for Mr.
Christopher Bogens and Mr. Mathew Moreton, Cape merchant and master of
the shipp <i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i>, she being ready to proceed on a voyage to
Manillias, she and the shipp <i class="shipname">Moyon</i> in her company, they going before
the rest of the fleete; the coppie of which remembrances I keepe by
me.</p>

<p>Gonrok Dono wrot to the King of Firando in the behalf of the
Portingall capt. moore, to have the ould Portingall which I kept in
howse sent to hym; of which the king sent me word with the letter of
Gonrok. Unto which I answered, I did keepe that Portugez per his
Highnesse leave and lycense formerly geven me, and soe desired to doe
till Ric. Short with our other English runawaies were retorned. Unto
which it seemed the king was content, for I heard nothing afterward.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 18</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 14</i>).&mdash;The 2 shipps, <i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i> and <i class="shipname">Moyen</i>,

Mr. Thomas Harod departed out of this worlde this day, towardes night,
after he had made his will.</p>

 Blank in MS.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 19</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 15</i>).&mdash;Mr. Harod was buryed this day, and left
per his will his wages in England due per Company, with his howses at
Blackwall, to his doughter, and to his wife 2 groates or 8 pence
starling, for that she should cleame noe parte of his goods in respect
she marryed in his abcense. Also he gave to me a gerdell and hangers
of velvet with silver buckelles and hooks, and also x <i class="measure">taies</i> bar
plate to make me a ring; and j C. rialles of 8 betwixt Mr. Edmond
Sayer and his yong doughter Joan, to part eaven, with his great chist
and bible to Mr. Ed. Sayer ditto.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 20</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 16</i>).&mdash;The King of Firando went on hunting
yistarday, accompanied with above 3000 men, into the mountayns, and
this day retorned with 7 or 8 fallo deare and as many wild boares or
pigges. And the king sent me a fallo deare, skyn, guttes and all, and
Semidone a wild swine or pigg.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 21</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 17</i>).&mdash;Capt. Leonard Camps and my selfe went
to the king to geve him to understand that tyme passed away and Gonrok
Dono came not, soe that it was expedient we departed forthwith to the
Emperours court to doe our dutie and carry our presentes, for that now
winter came on and, yf we went not presently, it was to late to goe
this yeare; soe that we were better to loose the friggatt and all the
goodes in her than encur the Emperours displeasure; yet, if his
Highnesse would, we cout at this instant produce witnesses suffitient
to prove the 2 men, in the Hollanders howse presoners, to be frires or
padres. But the king answered he could do nothing without Gonrok; soe
that this night he would send to hym per expres, to see whether he
would com or noe, and soe, upon his answere, we might departe.</p>

<p>Also Capt. Camps desired to have justis executed against
<!--215.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</span>
them which
did beate Capt. Lafevre. Unto which the king replied, what justis he
would have, for the doars thereof weare yet in preson. Capt. Camps
replied that he did not desire their lives, nether, yf it had byn
offered against hym selfe, would he speake any more about it, only in
respect of the abusse offerd against such a man as Comander Lafevre
was, he desired the same parties which offerd the abuse might be
brought to the place where they did it and be beaten with cudgells. At
which the king smiled and said it could not be, but, yf he would have
them cutt in peeces, he would doe it. But Capt. Camps said he desired
not their lives, yet that he would certifie Admerall Johnson and Capt.
Lafevre what he said.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 22</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 18</i>).&mdash;I rec. of Mr. Arthur Hatch, precher,
geven for the making of the buriall place 12 <i class="measure">ta.</i> 6 <i class="measure">m.</i>; more, 1 bar
plate of Mr. Chapman, 2 <i class="measure">ta.</i></p>

<p>Cuschcron Dono and Jenqueze Dono came to me and tould me the
Hollanders had lent iij M. <i class="measure">tais</i> to the <i class="title">tono</i> (or king) of this
place, and that he expected the like from us. Unto whome I answerd
that they know the booty which the Hollanders had brought into this
place, which we had noe parte of, and therefore might doe that which
we could not doe, having hitherto spent and geven away treble more
then we have gott; yet I would take councell with the rest of the
merchantes and se what might be donne and then geve them answer, for
it was against reason for us to take up money at intrest and lend to
others for nothing, and, besides, many other noble men sent to borow
money, we having non to lend, as they themselves did know as well as
we. Unto which they answerd, it was true, yet, notwithstanding, it was
fyt to lend to the king, he now standing in need, although we lent non
to the rest; for soe it behoved us, being strangers, yf we esteemed
our owne good.</p>

<p>And we sould all our small deare skins at 13 <i class="measure">tais</i> per cento, of them
which came in the <i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i>.</p>

<i class="day">October 23</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 19</i>).&mdash;I receved a quittance from Capt. Robt.
Adams, admerall, for 1814 R. of 8, at 5<i>s.</i> str. per R. of 8, for the
xvjth parte of priz goodes, to be geven in the fleete, for which Capt.
Adames is bound to make it good, yf the Honble. Company think it not
fyt to pay it. And soe the capt. of other shipps gave quittances to
Capt. Adams in like sort, to be answerable for that they rec. for
their shipps proporsion; and each comander took the like securety from
their shipps companies, that their wages should be answerable for it,
yf it were not alowed per the Honble. Company in England. Yet som
refuced to receve any money upon that termes, but the most parte did
accept of it. God grant those scabbed sheepe doe not in the end spoile
the whole flock.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 24</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 20</i>).&mdash;This day is the feast of hors-runing
with archars on horseback to shoute at a mark with bowes and arowes,
the horse runing his full carer.</p>

<p>Mr. Sayer retorned from Nangasaque within night, and brought news that
the <i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i> and <i class="shipname">Moyen</i> have taken a Portingall junck which went
out of Nangasaque and bound for Amacou.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 25</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 21</i>).&mdash;We and the Hollanders paid 900 <i class="measure">tais</i>
plate barrs to the King of Firando for the 200 <i class="measure">pico.</i> lead geven hym
in his present the last yeare.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 26</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 22</i>).&mdash;The <i>bongews</i> at Cochie did lay handes
upon our English men and (as the admerall, Capt. Adames, doth tell me)
have taken above 20, and sent hym word it was per order from the king.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 27</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 23</i>).&mdash;Mr. Cockram envited all the princepall,
both of English and Duch, abord the <i class="shipname">Elizabeth</i>, to dyner this day,
where we had good entertaynment and good cheare with healthes of guns
shott affe in good sort.</p>

<p>This night was very stormy wether, like to a tuffon, in which the
<i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i> broke a cable, and the <i class="shipname">Elizabeth</i> a cable and a hawser.</p>

<p><!--217.png--><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>
We complayned to the justis how our men were taken presoners per the
Japons without reason, they fordging debtes upon them which they owd
not, striping our men naked and taking from them all they had, when
they owed them nothing. Unto which, answer was made the king knew
nothing thereof.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 28</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 24</i>).&mdash;Capt. Camps and myselfe went to
Torazemon Dono to desire hym to speake to the king that we might go to
themperour with our presentes; and that we might deliver our presentes
to the king before we went up, because the shipps weare now ready to
departe. Also we made knowne unto hym the takeing and keeping our men
presoners, both English and Duch. Unto all which he answered, that the
king desired us to stay till the last of this moone <i class="day">Conguach</i>, for
that the 29th day (which is 5 daies hence) he expected Gonrok Dono to
come to Firando, for soe had he promised hym without fayle to doe. And
for the present to be deliverd unto hym before we deliverd our present
to themperour, it was not fitt, and therefore best to lett it rest
till we retorned from the Court. And for our men taken presoners, the
kinge knew nothing thereof, but now he would make it knowne unto hym
and retorne us his answer.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 30</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 26</i>).&mdash;I was enformed this day per Capt.
Lennis, Mr. Barrns being the man which tould it, that Mr. Arnold
Brown, master of the shipp <i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i>, hath stolne 5 fardelles of
silke of priz goodes and stowed them under his cabben, whereof Mr.
Trumpeter of <i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i> is witnesse; of the which I enformed Mr.
Eaton, Mr. Cockram, Mr. Sayer, and Mr. Ostarwick, and all together
made it knowne to the admerall, Capt. Robt. Adames, and Mr. Jno.
Munden. Soe it was agreed to serch his cabben to morow; but Mr. Arthur
Hatch, preacher in the same shipp (whose cabben is next to Mr.
Brownes) tould us that out of dowbt we should now find nothing theare,
it being
<!--218.png--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span>
formerly removed before shipp was upon a carin, yet that
he did see 4 or 5 bales brought in by others at sea and stowed theare.
Soe hereupon we staid the serch.</p>

<p><i class="day">October 31</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 27</i>).&mdash;We went abord the shipp <i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i> to
dyner, where all the Duch were envited likwaies.</p>

<p>And Capt. Camps came to thenglish house, where we agreed to sett
forward towardes themperours Court on Munday mornyng, yf the king of
this place did not stay us perforce, which a long time he hath
perswaded us unto.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 1</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 28</i>).&mdash;We dyned this day at China Capt., where
we had good entertaynment, both sea men and merchantes, with the
dansing beares.</p>

<p>And towardes night we had news that 3 of our howses at Cochie were
burned, being sett on fire by a retchlesse fello that did seeth the
kettell to neare the howse walle. All the howsing was quite burned to
the grownd, with som 9 barilles of tunny fish and 9 or 10 muskittes
and 20 swordes; but our seales and other matters of worth were saved
by the industry of our men with the helpe of the Hollanders and som
Japons. Yt is said most parte of the fish which was thought to be
burned was stole away per Japons, as also som 6 muskettes and som
swordes.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 2</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 29</i>).&mdash;I went to Cochie to see what hurt the
fire had donne, and fownd it as I before discribed, only many of our
truck plankes, with bordes and other tymbers, were much burned or
scubered, but quenched in good tyme.</p>

<p>And the king sent to me to know my answer whether I would pay the
debtes our marrenars owed, that were per the Japons taken presoners.
Unto which I answerd, no, for that they had trusted them contrary to
his Highnesse proclemation to trust non but such as broght money; and
besides they taxed our men to owe them 10 tymes more then was due unto
them, beating them and striking them
<!--219.png--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span>
naked, and per force taking all
the money from other men which owed them nothing; of the which I ment
to demand justis from his Highnesse, and that our men might be sett
free, for that the Emperour would suffer us to carry noe Japons in our
shiping, and therefore no reason to keepe our men per force, which
they might do yf they pleased, but I would never consent to pay a peny
of that the Japons demanded. Unto which they answerd that the king
would not keepe our men.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 3</i> (<i class="day">Conguach 30</i>).&mdash;I sent the <i>caboques</i> 4 <i class="measure">tais</i> small
plate for <i>fannos</i> at China Capt. howse.</p>

<p>I wrot a peticion this day to the king, making knowne the taking our
men presoners with other abuses offerd to our nation, requiring our
men to be sett at libertie.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 5</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 2</i>).&mdash;Gonrok Dono and Feze Dono arived at
Firando this day; and Gonrok Dono sent me a present of 2 silk
<i>kerremons</i>, and Feze Dono sent me 500 egges, 30 hense, and 25 drid
netes tonges.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 6</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 3</i>).&mdash;I paid in small plate as followeth,

And we and the Hollanders were called before the king, where we found
Gonrok Dono, Feze Dono, and others, which caused the 2 padres,
presoners in the Hollands howse, to be brought before them, with the
capt. of the friggatt and others, where all our papers were perused,
and amongst the rest a letter or ordinance from the Bushopp of
Manillia, authoresing frire Pedro de Sunega to be prior and vicker
generall over all Christians in all provinces of Japon, with other
letters to conferme it. Yet this frire did utterly deny it, and that
he was a merchant and noe frire. Soe then we produced 2 witnesses, the
one a Portugez, called Ravelles, and the other an inhabitant of the
Manillias; both which confessed they knew frire Pedro de Sunega to be
a padre of the order of St. Augustin, and Ravelles said he had seene
hym say mas in the howse of Alvaro Munios at Nangasaque, and that
Harnando Ximenes did see the like. Soe for this tyme the king and
Gonrok Dono did dismis us, and gave noe sentence, but willed us to
produce more witnesses. Unto which we answerd we could produce noe
more, and willed them to make an end of it, as God should put it into
their mind, to thentent we might procead on our voyage to vizet the
Emperour. But they replied they would call us to morow or next day and
make an end yf they could.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_105" id="footnote_105"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_105"><span class="muchsmaller">[105]</span></a>
 Perhaps a jack, or large flagon, of <i>makiye</i> or
lacquer.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 7</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 4</i>).&mdash;We and the Hollanders went to the
pallace, being called per the king to dispute our matter about the
frigatt; where we found Gonrok Dono, Feze Dono, and the rest, of
Nangasaque, and shewed other writeinges to prove this Pedro de Suniga
to be a father and prior and vicar generall of all the Cbristians in
Japon. And the king sent for Harnando Ximenes and Lues the telor to
reade over the letters in Spanish, but nether the one nor other would
doe it. And soe late we retorned; it being ordayned to make an end to
morow. But the king, with Semi Dono and others, sent us word secretly
to stand
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span>
to that which we had spoaken, and then we needed not to
feare to get our processe, for that 7 of ten had allready geven their
voices on our sides.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 8</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 5</i>).&mdash;We and the Duch made our selves ready to
have gon to the pallace, to have made an end of our processe of the
frigat; but after nowne word was sent us to stay till to morow, for
that Feze Dono was sick. But the matter was, for that they were
envited to the China Capt., Andrea Dittis, to dyner. And the China
Capt. tould me that the King of Firando sent for hym in secret, and
asked hym whether he knew this Pedro de Sunega to be a padre or no.
Unto which he answered he knew hym to be a padre, as his sonne
Augustin did the like, being at Manillas; yet, in respect he lived at
Nangasaque, and that Gonrok Dono was his frend, he did not desire to
be seene in the matter. And towardes night Torazemon Dono went to
Hollands howse and sent for me thether, and tould us that of 10 which
were of the councell proving them fathars, 7 weare on our side, and
the rest could stand upon nothing but to ask us what was the occation
that these two denied themselves to be fathers, all the rest
confessing them to be such at first demand; to the which we should
take councell how to answer, when we were to com before the king and
Gonrok Dono. Also, at same tyme, the 3 Japon <i>jurebassos</i>, which came
with Gonrok Dono from Nangasaque, came to Hollands howse to demand
lycense to have private conferrence with the 2 fryres, presoners; but
the king sent us secret adviz not to consent unto it. Soe answer was
made unto them that they should not com to speech of them except it
were in presence of the king and Gonrok Dono and the rest of the
justices.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 9</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 6</i>).&mdash;The king with Gonrok Dono went a fishing
this day; soe we had noe audience about our plito. Yet the king sent
us word to stand to that we formerly proposed, and to answer to certen
demandes as he
<!--222.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</span>
gave us the forme how to doe, and not to think any
ill, yf he were sharpe in speeches against us, which he would doe of
purpose to blind our enemis.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 10</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 7</i>).&mdash;I paid in plate of barrs to Jno. Japon:
for Susannas slave Ita, 12:&nbsp;0:&nbsp;0; for a sett of <i>gocas</i> for her,
6:&nbsp;5:&nbsp;0.</p>

<p>The China Capt. gave me a silver tastar and a silver dish to sett it
upon, poiz both 4 <i class="measure">ta.</i> 4 <i>ma.</i><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_106" id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The shipp <i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i> went out this day to Cochie roade.</p>

<p>I staid all this day attending to goe to Court about our plito; but,
as I am enformed, Gonrok desireth the king we should stay till som men
com from Nangasaque, which he hath sent for. And, as it is said, this
Gonrok Dono did report in themperours Court that we and the Hollanders
did of mallice accuse these Spaniardes to be fathers, which he knewe
were non such, and that upon payne of his life he would prove it to be
soe. But now, finding our testemony to be such as it is and canot be
denied, he knoweth not what to doe, but useth all <i>trampas</i><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_107" id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span>and
fetches he can to delay tyme and bring it to nothing per all meanes he

<p><i class="day">November 11</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 8</i>).&mdash;Gonrok Dono and others sent both us and
the Hollanders word that they would send to call 10 padres or frires
which were presoners at Umbra, and that we should make choise of any 3
or 4 of them to be wittnesses whether the 2 prisoners at Hollandes
howse were fathers or no. But we retorned answer that we knew not
whether those 10 men they spake of were fathers or noe; nether would
we have to doe with them nor put the matter to their discretion, which
we had soe manifestly proved allready.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 12</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 9</i>).&mdash;I went to Torazemon Dono to tell hym
againe of the abuses daylie offered to our
<!--223.png--><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span>
English marrenars, at
Cochie espetially, desiring to have redresse; and that I would send
one of our <i>jurebassos</i> to the admerall, Capt. Adames, at Cochie, to
look out in all howses where our men were thus abused and to take true
notis hereof, as his Highnesse (the king) had ordayned. The which he
answered me was well donne, and that this day he would put the king
againe in mind therof and tell hym what I said. But sowne after he
sent his man unto me to tell me the king would take order that our men
should all be set at libertie, whether they owed money or noe.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 13</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 10</i>).&mdash;The Duch shipp <i class="shipname">Trowe</i> went to Cochie

writing in the Japon languadg, per councell of the king of this place,
directed to Gonrok Dono and the king, wherin we advized that, our
proves against the padres being made, we would say noe more in that
matter, but left it to their discresions to doe therein what they
pleased, we attesting we took them as our enemies, and did not know
they weare padres till they confessed it themselves; nether would we
have to doe with any padres they
<!--224.png--><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span>
brought from Umbra or Nangasaque
to be judges in our affares tuching that matter, nor would not beleeve
nether them nor any other Spaniardes nor Portingales they should
produce in that matter, houlding them parsiall and our enemies in that
matter. Soe we desired leave to departe towardes themperours Court to
doe our duties; and sent this writing per our 2 <i>jurebassos</i> to
Gonrok Dono. And he caused them to cary it to the King of Firando,
accompanied with one of his owne men.</p>

<p>And the ambassadors of the King of Syam, which are now retorned from
themperours Court, where they were royally receved, did com to vizet
our English howse, accompanied with Capt. Yasimon Dono of Nangasaque
and a man which themperour sent with them from Edo to accompany them
to Nangasaque. The ambassador gave me a barrill of wyne for a present,
and the Japon which accompanid hym from Edo an other. And the
ambassador requested me to geve hym a letter of favour with an English
flagg, yf in case they met with any English or Hollandes shipps at
sea; and Capt. Yasimon Dono did desire the like: which I promised to
them both to performe. And I sent a pottell glasse bottell of annise
water for a present to the ambassador, which he took in very good
part.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 15</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 12</i>).&mdash;We were sent for to the Court to make
an end of our processe with the padres, where we found 4 padres of the
presoners of Umbra, one being a Japon, as also Lues Martin, Balthazar
Martin, Alvaro Munios, Pinta a woaman, with divers others, brought in
by Gonrok Dono to doe what in them la to witnesse against us; where
many speeches passed, but non would confesse they knew them to be
padres, but our two witnesses stood still to their word, although
foule mouthed Munios did revile them. And so we were remitted till to
morow. Yet I was secretly advized it would goe on our side, and that
the capt. of the friggat was to suffer death
<!--225.png--><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>
with others; but Yochian Dies,
the capt., desired that I or Capt. Camps might suffer death with hym,
according to the use of Japon, that he which causeth an other man to
die must goe the same way hym selfe.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 16</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 13</i>).&mdash;I sent Domingo <i>jurebasso</i>, with the
boteswaine and pursers mate of the shipp <i class="shipname">Moone</i>, to look out in every
Japons howse at Cochie where they kept our Englishmen presoners, where
they fownd som with boultes and shakelles, others with cheanes, others
bownd and pineoned with ropes, som owing nothing to the Japons, and
others tormented because they would not confesse they owed 4 or 5
times more to Japons then was due to them. All which I put up in a
writing and delivered it to the King of Firandos councell to have
redresse.</p>

<p>And Oyen Dono came and tould me that we were sure to get our processe
of the friggat; and Cushcron Dono tould me the like, and that he
thought divers others weare like to suffer death about it.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 17</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 14</i>).&mdash;Within night the Hollanders and we
were sent for to the Court about our plito with the padres (or frires)
which also were sent for. And we remeaned theare till 11 or 12 a
clock, and came not to sight of the king, and then had leave to
departe; only in that tyme they sent for 2 letters directed to frier
padre Tomas, a Japon padre, presoner at Umbra, and now brought to
Firando, as I noted heretofore. And, as we are secretly enformed, this
frire hath confessed that the 2 presoners at Hollands howse are
padres, for he was all day in company with the king and Gonrok Dono in
secret conference, and, as it is said, will turne gentell againe, or
at least renege his pristhood, to save his life. And, as som say,
Gonrok Dono is suspected to be a Christian.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 18</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 15</i>).&mdash;The shipp <i class="shipname">Elizabeth</i> went out of Firando to Cochie.</p>

<p>And the King of Firando sent for the Hollanders and us
<!--226.png--><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span>
to make an end
of the plito of the padres; where we fownd above xx Japon Christians
renegados, whome Gonrok Dono had brought from Nangasaque to see yf
they knew whether these two fathers were padres or no. Among whome was
a blind man, bad to see another, yet by his voice he tould the King of
Firando that he knew hym to be fraire Pedoro de Sunega; yet, as I
understood, the King of Firando will not admit hym for a witnesse,
because he is of Firando; but I know not whether he doe it as a frend,
knowing we have other witnesses enow, or else to bring us to other
trialles. Once the end will try all. And in the end the king hym selfe
came out and asked Capt. Camps and me whether we had other matter to
say or no against the fathers. Unto whome we answerd noe, desiring to
have lycense to departe towardes themperours Court, for that tyme
passed. Unto which the king made answer that he would permitt us to
departe when he pleased.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 19</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 16</i>).&mdash;We are enformed that Gonrok Dono would
have had the King of Firando joyne with hym to refer the plito about
the friggatt before themperours councell at Edo, but the king tould
hym he would now end it heare, we having soe manifest testemony as we
have on our side to prove the 2 presoners padres.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 20</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 17</i>).&mdash;I receved ij C. <i class="measure">tais</i> plate barrs of
Tozamon Dono, our host of Osackay, in parte of payment of 256 <i class="measure">tais</i>
due for 128 peces Canton damasks of the deceased Capt. Wm. Adames.</p>

<p>And the king sent 4 ruch sleeping <i>kerremons</i> of silke in present
to thadmerall, Capt. Adams, to be disposed of as I should adviz hym.
They were worth j C. <i class="measure">tais</i> barr plate.</p>

<p>And the king and Gonrok Dono sent for me and the Hollandes capt. to
bring Gonsalo Ravello, our witnesse against Alvaro Munois; which we
did, and he stood still to his first speeches how he saw frire Pedro
de Sunega say mas in his howse; yet the frire denied it. And I think
<!--227.png--><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 223]</span>
Munois was hanged by the purse and soe cleared. And the capt. of the
friggot, Yochin Dies, with 29 others, are bound and put into preson,
we geting our plito of frigot.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 21</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 18</i>).&mdash;The Duch admerall, Wm. Johnson, and
Capt. Adames, our admerall, retorned to Firando; and we, with Capt.
Camps, Capt. Lafevre, and others, went to vizet the king and carid hym
a present of 2 <i>barricas</i> Spanish sack, j <i>barrica</i> of tent, and 2
jarrs of sweet meate, and gave hym thankes for the presentes of
<i>kerremons</i>; and soe took leave for the fleet to goe out to morow.</p>

<p>And Capt. Adames left the 4 sleeping silk coates with me till his
retorne from Manillias.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 22</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 19</i>).&mdash;Our fleet of 8 shipps, English and
Duch, went to sea this morning on their second voyage for Manillias.
God send them good speed. Viz.:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i class="day">November 23</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 20</i>).&mdash;This morning the fleet put to sea,
but, as I am enformed from Capt. Adams, thadmerall, want 12 of our
men, and Mr. Cockram writes me want 17, all kept presoners per Japons
ashore, contrary to the kinges comand; and yet Capt. Adames sent a
boate of porpose ashore with 150 R. of 8 to have redeemed them, but
they asked above 200 R. of 8 more. Soe Capt. Adams wrot me that yf
they were retorned after his departure, to put them all out of wagis,
as villans and traitors to their prince and cuntrey, and soe to send
them in cheanes for Jaccatra, in the Duch shipp <i>New Zeland</i>, when she
goeth.</p>

<p>Ther is 4 Hollanders alsoe kept presoners ashore. And the <i>bongews</i>
took 5 <i>cattans</i> from Mr. Sayer, 1 from Capt. Adams, and 1 from Capt.
Cleavengar, and 1 from Mr.

Mourton. Mr. Sayer hath had his above
5 yeares, and Capt. Adames brought his out of England, and Mr. Morton
bought his in Sumatra at Janbee.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 24</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 21</i>).&mdash;Mr. Eaton retorned from our fleete,
shipps departed, and brought me divers letters from Capt. Adames, Mr.
Cockram, Capt. Lennis, and others, wherin they wrot me of the
detayning of our men on shore, as I noted before. Of the which I went
and conferred with Capt. Camps; and he is of opinion with us not to
pay any thinge, seeing they have detayned our men till shipps be gon.
Alsoe he was very ernest with me to stay 7 or 8 dayes to dispach
busynes for his two shipps which are heare, and, as I am enformed,
hath envited the king to dynner 6 daies hence, yet tould me nothing
thereof, for that he would get the start of us to envite the king,
leveing us noe tyme to doe the like, or else stay us longer to doe his
busynes.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 25</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 22</i>).&mdash;I went to Torazemon Dono and Semi Dono
to thank them for their paines taken about our busynes, telling them
that it was now tyme to goe to themperours Court, our shipps being
gone. And they tould me I had reason, as alsoe the Hollanders, soe to
doe, for that Cacazemon Dono, secretary to Oyen Dono, themperours
cheefe councellar, had wrot the King of Firando a letter that the
Spaniardes and Portingales had ended their busynes and we and the
Hollanders had noe care to com to prevent them in their proceadinges,
which he marveled at.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 26</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 23</i>).&mdash;I went to Hollandes howse to confer
about our going up to Court; and Capt. Camps tould me that to morow
the king came to dyner, sending hym word he would have my company
theare or else he would not come, and soe after to morow we might
departe towardes Edo. And in the meane tyme the kyng sent Stroyemon
Dono before us to the Court, to be theare before Gonrok Dono, whoe
departed from hence 2 daies past secretly to goe to Edo.</p>

<p><!--229.png--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>
Also our presoners at Cochie wrot a letter how they are almost
famished; yet too good a diet for such villens. And Francis Irland
wrot me aparte that he is in for an other mans debt.</p>

<p>And Capt. Camps came to our howse to talke about our busynes; and we,
having made ready som xj peces ordinance to have shott off at Gonroks
departure, gave them hym for a farewell; and the Duch answered with 6.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 27</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 24</i>).&mdash;The king dyned at Duch howse with all
his nobilletie, I being sent for and sett second at table on his right
hand, whether I would or noe; where we had great cheare with musick,
after our cuntrey fation, singing and dansing, with ordinance shott
affe at every tyme the king drunk, 7 per the Duch, and answered with 5
per thenglish; and, when the king went away, xj peces from the Duch
and as many from thenglish for a farewell, and 5 peces for Semi Dono
as he passed per water per English howse.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 28</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 25</i>). We went to the king, the Hollanders and
us, to take our leave to goe to themperours Court; and he told us the
sowner the better; also that he had sent Stroyemon Dono, his
<i>bongew</i>, before, to be theare before Gonrok Dono, to prevent falce reportes
till we came.</p>

<p>And the <i>bongew</i> of Cochie came to our howse, and said yf we would not
pay the money for the men presoners, that they would cary them to
Crates, Chicongo,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_108" id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span>
Nangasaque, and sell them, or make their best
endevours to recover the money they owed Japons. Unto whome I answerd,
to take heed what he did, as he would answer it with his life before
the Emperour of Japon, whoe had geven order we should cary noe Japons
out of his cuntrey in our shiping, and, therefore, noe reason they
should detayne our Englishmen and father falce debtes upon them when
they owed nothing.</p>

<p>to goe on our voyage for Edo.</p>

<p>Towardes night the king sent to me to know what I would have donne
with the Englishmen presoners at Cochie, and whether I would pay the
money they weare kept for, for that they weare subjectes to the kings
of Xasma, Crates, Chicongo, and other places, and would, yf I paid not
the money, carry them away. Unto which I answerd that it weare men of
Firando which detayned them, and, namely, one Cuze Dono, our next
neighbour, and others, contrary to the kinges comand that non should
trust them except they brought money; and, yf they weare of other
kingdoms which detayned them, I knew noe reason they should have more
preveleges then them of Firando, in regard the Emperour had comanded
that we should carry noe Japons out in our shipps, it was noe reason
that Japons should detayne Englishmen per force and fayne debtes upon
them which they owed not, as these Japons did, and took men and kept
them presoners which owed them nothing. And for me to pay money for
their releasment, I could not, they being sea men, and the English
<!--231.png--><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>
admerall having geven me order to the contrary, he first having sent
150 R. of 8 to have redemed them, and 10 R. more was offered, but all
refused, and our men detained per force against all reason. Soe I
could say nothing till the fleete retorned; but in the meane tyme
willed them take heed how they sent them to be disposed of per our
enemies, as they would answer it to themperor.</p>

<p><i class="day">November 30</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 27</i>).&mdash;We and the Hollanders sett forwardes
towardes Edo, but, the wind being N.erly with rayne, we went into an
Iland of Firando called Onshma, 3 leagues from Firando.</p>

<p>But, before we went out, the Japons of Cochie came to our English
howse, bawling and crying out for payment of the money thenglishmen
owed them, or else they would cary them away and make their best of
them. I answerd I would not consent they should cary them away, nether
would pay them any thing, for that they weare villens and had imagened
falce debtes, saying English men owed them money when they owed them
non; and that, yf I weare not now ready to set my foote into the bark
to departe towardes themperours Court, I would have laid them all by
the heeles till our men were set at liberty.</p>

<p>Also the king sent 2 men, our enemis, after me, to tell me the
Hollanders had lent hym 6,000 <i class="measure">taies</i>, and I denied to lend any, and
bad them tell me he had noe need of any money, and therefore sent them
to tell me soe much. But I sent his Highnesse word that I had left
order with Mr. Eaton to lett hym have silk with mantas or lynen cloth
and other matters to the vallue of 3000 <i class="measure">tais</i>, at same price the
Hollanders lett his Highnesse have theirs; but, for money, I had non,
as many in Firando knew it well, and, to take up money at intrest and
lend it out for nothing, I knew not how to geve our honble. employers
acco. of it; yet, yf his Highnesse would needes have it soe, it must
be soe. But the <i>jurebasso</i>, Nicolas Martyn, sent from the king, tould
me
<!--232.png--><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span>
that the 3000 <i class="measure">tais</i> I offerd was well, and would be taken in as
good part as 6000 of the Hollanders, and that the other two which came
(would not com abord) were our enemies, and had enformed the king of
untruthes.</p>

<p>The dansing beares came out after us, and I gave them a bar of plate
containing 4 <i class="measure">ta.</i> 7 <i>ma.</i>, and Capt. Camps as much.</p>

<p><i class="day">December 1</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 28</i>).&mdash;After midnight we departed from
Onushma, and went to Ginushma before the wind turned, haveing made 38
leagues.</p>

<p><i class="day">December 2</i> (<i class="day">Junguach 29</i>).&mdash;This morning, after sunne rising, we
departed from Ginushma, and wind at W.N.W., and soe contynewd all day
and night following. Soe at 2 a clock after nowne we arived at Ximina
Seak,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_109" id="fnanchor_109"></a><a href="#footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></span>
and fownd the Hollanders departed from thence 2 howers
before, Capt. Camps having left me a letter, and Stroyemon Dono
another that Gonrok Dono departed from thence yistarday; soe they took
councell to follow hym, that Stroyemon Dono might be at Edo before
him. Soe I left a letter with our host at Ximina Seak to send to Mr.
Eaton, dated this day of our arivall at this place, and that he should
lett the king of Firando have all the kense (?) silk and bleu lynen at
as loe a rate as the Hollanders sould theirs, as also the money which
the 2 peces broad cloth weare sould for, and, yf any thing wanted to
make up 3000 <i class="measure">taies</i>, to let hym have it in money or comodities.</p>

<p>Soe this day and night we got 42 leagues, 8 leagues short of Camina

came to dyner abord our bark.</p>

<p><i class="day">December 5</i> (<i class="day">Shimutsque 3</i>).&mdash;We departed from Ewe and rowed 2
leagues to a place called Zewa; and in the way saw a bark cast away,
and sent out our and the Hollanders small boates, whoe saved the men.</p>

<p><i class="day">December 6</i> (<i class="day">Shimutsque 4</i>).&mdash;At night we departed from Zewa, it
being calme, and rowed it xiij leagues before we came to an ancor. We
paid xv. <i>mas</i> to howse and for oringes at Zewa, and gave a sack of
rise to the men which we saved out of the wreck, they being of Bongo.</p>

<p><i class="day">December 7</i> (<i class="day">Shimutsque 5</i>).&mdash;We arived within night at Bingana
Tomo, wheare I went ashore and made consort for [neales, spikes, and
iron hoopes].</p>

<p>Soe we made this day 15 leagues till night.</p>

<p><i class="day">December 8</i> (<i class="day">Shimutsque 6</i>).&mdash;We departed from Bingana Tomo at
midnight past, and got this day to Moro before sunne seting, having
made 30 leagues, with such extreame wynde that we weare not able to
beare but very littell seale. The Hollanders bark went out 2 howers
before us, yet we overtook her and out went her 2 leagues before we
weare aware, yet went into Moro together. And here we understood
Gonrok Dono went from hence 2 daies past.</p>

<p><i class="day">December 9</i> (<i class="day">Shimutsque 7</i>).&mdash;We departed from Moro at xj a clock

<p>And the Hollanders did the like. Yet, as we passed the flattes of
Osackay, we were on grownd divers tymes; yet,<!--234.png--><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>

of Firandos queene, as well as to her; but he was of opinion (as I the
like) that we ment not to geve any to the doughter but for the

say the truth we have geaven away all allready, that nothing of worth
restes to geve.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 21</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 20</i>).&mdash;I went to Capt. Camps to take councell
what we were best to doe about delivering our petition to the
Emperours councell to have our oulde preveleges confermed to cary out
men and munition our shipps in payment for it, as we have donne in

were best to stay till the councell advized us to make knowne unto
them yf we were greved in any thinge and we should be remedied, and
then we might mak our case knowne; otherwais, yf we went about to doe
it before that tyme, it would be throwne by, and noe respect had unto
it. Soe we aledged we dowbted then we should be detayned here over
long; but they promised the contrary.</p>

and, after,
I sent hym to the Court to procure our dispach, but could effect

<p><i class="day">January 25</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 24</i>).&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> againe to the

Only the councell gave hym fare wordes, and bad hym com againe to

<p>Also I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to the Court to procure our dispach; but
retorned without doing any thing. And our <i>bongew</i>, Stroyemon Dono,

of our nations more then ever, by meanes we had soe well defended our
selves in our plito against the padres, and that we should be
dispached shortly to our content. Also they tould me that the sonne of
Masseamon Dono would com to vizet both us and the Hollanders to morow,
which we agreed should be at Hollanders lodging, it being more
comodious than ours.</p>

<p><!--244.png--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span>
Also our <i>jurebasso</i> was at Court all day, and procured nothing.</p>

not. Nether could we doe any thing for our dispach, being now answerd
we must attend 8 days more till the cheefe of the feast be past.</p>

<p><i class="day">January 30</i> (<i class="day">Shiwas 29</i>).&mdash;We went and deliverd our presentes to the

the 6th of this moone

cytty and a great pagod called Assackxa, dedicated to a Japon saint
(or rather deavill) called Quannow. We gave 1000 <i>gins</i> to the <i>bose</i>
to shew it us, and 2 <i>ichebos</i> to an other <i>bos</i> where we banqueted.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 5</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 5</i>).&mdash;I went with Capt. Camps to the howse of
Oyen Dono, themperours secretary, to have delivered hym a present of a
peece of currall containing 2&#189; <i class="measure">taies</i>, and a <i>catty</i> wight rich
campher, and to wish hym a good new yeare; but he was gon out to vizet
the prince, themperours sonne.</p>

<p>And Cacazemon Dono and Stroyemon Dono came to vizet me, the first
bringing me a present of wallnuttes and a salt salmon.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 7</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 7</i>).&mdash;We dyned all at Hollandes lodging this
day, where we fownd Stroyemon Dono and Gentero Donos secretary. And,
as we weare at dyner, came word Torazemon Dono was arived. Soe Capt.
Camps and I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to bid hym wellcom.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 8</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 8</i>).&mdash;Torazemon Dono sent me a present of 2
<i class="measure">barsos</i> wine, 2 wilduckes, and a great fresh barbell.</p>

<p>And I rec. by hym a letter from Mr. Eaton, dated in Firando the 26th
December, with 2 others from Tome <i>jurebasso</i> and Jno. <i>jurebasso</i>,
how they have delivered 3000 <i class="measure">taies</i> in merchandiz and money to King
of Firando, lent to hym, and that the Japons have sent our English men
to Nangasaque to sell them to Spaniardes.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 9</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 9</i>).&mdash;Mr. Eaton wrot me in his letter how the
Japons at Cochie had beate the Hollanders pilot and an other marrenar
at Cochie, that they left them
<!--246.png--><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>
for dead; and the reason was because
they would not deliver them back our 6 English men which weare fled
abord for releefe; and that they used both us and the Hollanders soe
villanosly that it was insufferable.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 10</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 10</i>).&mdash;We sent Mr. Osterwick with our 2
<i>jurebassos</i> for thenglish and Duch, to deliver our petition to Otto
Dono, the kinges councellor; but he would not receve it, but bad them
com againe to morrow and deliver it before the whole Councell, for
that he hym selfe would not receve it.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 11</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 11</i>).&mdash;Capt. Camps and I went vizet
Torazemon Dono, and carid a present because of the new year, telling
hym we did not present it for a present, but for a custom of the new
yeare, not to goe emptie handed to a man of his qualletye and our
espetiall frend. And at same tyme came Jentero Donos secretary with
Shroyemon Dono, the <i>bongew</i>, and Cacazemon Dono, with an other of
themperours men, which I esteemed to be an espie sent of purpose to
heare what we said. For Torazemon Dono was somthing forward in his
speeches, saying Mr. Eaton had refused to geve meate to the Japon
presoners left in our English howse by comandment of the King of
Firando and Gonrok Dono. But I answerd that I left order with Mr.
Eaton soe to do, and that we had no processe against those Japons,
which yf Gonrok Dono had let hym fynd a preson out of thenglish howse
and meate for them....</p>

<p><i class="day">February 12</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 12</i>).&mdash;There was an earthquake about sunne
setting.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 13</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 13</i>).&mdash;There was an other earthquake this morning
about an hower after sunne rising, but of small contynewance.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 14</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 14</i>).&mdash;The Emperours councell sent us and
the Duch word that they would geve us noe absolute answer about our
petition till the King of Firando com hym selfe to Edo; but, for the
rest, the Emperour would geve us leave to departe within 3 or 4 daies.</p>

<p><!--247.png--><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span>
<i class="day">February 15</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 15</i>).&mdash;I took councell with Capt. Camps to
make a demand to Torazemon Dono about the sending our men to
Nangasaque to sell them, contrary to his promise and the king his
master, at our departure from Firando. And Torazemon denied that our
men were not sent to Nangasaque, nor that the king knew nothing
thereof. Soe then I produced the 2 letters sent from our <i>jurebassos</i>,
to conferme it.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 16</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 16</i>).&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to Court to
procure our dispach, but could effect nothing; only they said the
feast of the berth of the yong prince (themperours eldest sonne) was
celebrated this day, and to morow the anniversary or dying day of
Ogosho Samma is to be celebrated.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 17</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 17</i>).&mdash;I wrot a letter to Firando to Mr.
Eaton and Mr. Hatch, of arival heare of Gonrok Dono and Torazemon
Dono; and that now we must stay for an answer of our petision till the
King of Firando com hym selfe; and that Torazemon Dono denieth that
our Englishmen are not sent to Nangasaque to be sould, neither knoweth
the King of Firando any such matter; and that, for the rest, we hope
to be dispached within 4 or 5 daies, and leve our <i>jurebassos</i> heare
for the rest till the King of Firando com, which, as we are enformed,
is now in the way; and that this day Capt. Camps and my selfe put in
writing our grevanses, to deliver them to Torazemon Dono and King
Firandos brother.</p>

<p>And Capt. Camps came and brought the articles which we ment to present
to the King of Firandos brother and to Torazemon Dono, wrot in Japons,
the coppies whereof we keepe; in which we laid open all our grevanses,
having remeaned soe many yeares in Japon and setled our selves at
Firando, when we might as well have made choise of any other province
in Japon, and now to be soe misused to have som of our people kild and
others extremly misused; and,<!--248.png--><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 244]</span>
lastly, others carid away captives to
be sould to our enemies; which yf it were not remedied, there was noe
staying for us in Japon. Unto which Torazemon Dono answered that all
should be amended and our people retorned, and that the King of
Firando, his master, knew nothing therof. But I dowbt all will prove
words, as hitherto we doe finde it. Yet Torazemon Dono sent word he
would now procure our dispach to content.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 18</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 18</i>).&mdash;This morning, at break of day, there
was an earthquake, which shaked a greate while.</p>

<p>Capt. Camps and the Duch dyned with us this day, and envited thenglish
to dyner to morow, and, after, to see a play or <i>caboque</i>.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 19</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 19</i>).&mdash;Capt. Camps envited us to dyner this
day, and, after, to a Japon play or commody, all plaied by men and
boyes, and noe woamen; at which was Torazemon Dono, with Jentero Donos
secretary and Stroyemon Dono, our <i>bongew</i>; and divers others
brought bankettes, as Capt. Camps host, Jno. Jossens sonne in lawe,
and others.</p>

<p>And at our retorne we found our hostis sistar, Madalina Samma, and her
husband Andrea, come from Oringaua; and she brought me a present of 2
wild duckes, with great shelfishes and 2 Japon <i>muches</i> as bigg
as cheeses.</p>

<p>And late at night Yasimon Dono, Gonrok Donos clark, came to vizet me,
as he said, unknowne to his master, and tould me his master thought
much in that we and the Hollanders did vizet Chawno Shozero Dono at
Miaco and came not to hym, his howse being in the same streete, right
over against the other, and he, as he thought, in frenshipp with both
our nations. Unto which I answered that I did not know his Lordshipps
howse was in that street, nether that he was in Miaco; but, to the
contrary, was enformed he was at Fushamy; and therefore desired pardon
yf I had
<!--249.png--><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span>
offended therin; and that I ment to vizet his Lordshippe
before I went from hence, as I made accompt Capt. Camps would doe the
like; only I was ashamed we had noe good thing to present his
Lordshipp withall, and to goe emptie handed to a personage of his
quallety was not good. But he answered me that was all one, whether we
carid a present or noe; only he knew we should be welcom and our
visetation taken in good parte; but I should not say he came to me.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 20</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 20</i>).&mdash;We could doe nothing at Court this
day for our dispach, because it is a great feast, all the shops being
shut up and an end made of the feast of Shonguach.</p>

<p>Also Torazemon Dono, with the other gentelmen at play yistarday,
envited per Capt. Camps, did envite them selves for to morow to an
other Japon play to me, which I could not deny. Soe I envited Capt.
Camps and the Duch to it, with the Hollandes host, and Jno. Yossens
sonne, and the children and others of Capt. Adams, our host.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 21</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 21</i>).&mdash;We went to the play and, as I passed
by the Hollanders lodging, I entred in and there found the King of
Fingo or Figen,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_134" id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span>
a brave yong man, and hath 50 <i>mangocas</i> of rent
per anno. He went to see the Hollanders because on of the Hollanders
servantes had served hym before, and, as he tould me, ment to have com
to vizet me, had I not com thether. He used me with greate curtesie
and offered greate frenshipp to all our nation, yf we came into his
cuntrey.</p>

<i class="day">February 26</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 26</i>).&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to the Court
to procure our dispach, but effected nothing. Soe Capt. Camps and my
selfe thought to have gon to the Councell to have shewed our selves,
hoping it would have procured our spidiar dispach, and, to that
entent, sent word to Torazemon Dono and Stroyemon Dono to desire them
to accompanie us. But they retorned answer it were better we staid
this day, and they them selves would goe and see what they could doe,
which, yf it would not take effect, then we might goe to morrow or the
next day.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 27</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 27</i>).&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to the Court,
to procure our despach, but effected nothing; only Otto Dono said to
our <i>jurebasso</i> that he should write downe the names of the Duch and
English, and they should have answer to morow, for that he would shew
it to the rest of the Councell.</p>

<p><i class="day">February 28</i> (<i class="day">Shonguach 28</i>).&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> againe to the
Court to gett our dispach; but retorned without doing any thinge, they
saying it was a greate hollyday, but I could not understand for what
sainte.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 2</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 1</i>).&mdash;Capt. Camps and I went to the Court betyme
this morning, and, per meanes of Cacazemon Dono, spoake with his
master Oyen Dono, desiring to have lycense to departe. And he gave us
good wordes and said it was trew we had staid heare a long tyme, but
now he would speake to themperour to get our dispach, and to that
entent we should send our <i>jurebassos</i> to the Court to morow that the
rest of the Councell might see them, and then he would put them in
mynd to dispach us.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 3</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 2</i>).&mdash;The Hollanders and we sent our <i>jurebassos</i>
to the Court to get our dispach. And they were answerd by the Councell
we should be dispached to morow; but I think it will be after a
skervie fation, for nether our <i>bongew</i>, Shroyemon Dono, nor Torazemon
Dono have com at us these 5 or 6 daies, nor soe much as sent to us.
Soe
<!--251.png--><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>
I think our matters at Firando will groe worse and worse, till we
be driven out of Japon.</p>

<p>There was an earthquake this evening about 9 a clock at night, which
shook much for a small tyme.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 4</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 3</i>).&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to Court, as the
Duch did the like, to procure our dispach; but had nothing but wordes,
saying they were busy in Councell about other matters, but would
remember us shortly. Soe I think (as Capt. Camps is of same opinion)
that they would keepe us heare till the King of Firando com, which it
may be will not be this 2 monthes.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 5</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 4</i>).&mdash;I wrot 2 letters, viz. one to Skengro Dono
to Miaco, to give covart to the other to Mr. Eaton and Mr. Hatch at
Firando. In this letter I advized, yf any of our shiping came into
Japon before our retorne, to let them stay at Cochie and not com into
Firando, nor put their ordinance nor munision ashore.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 6</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 5</i>).&mdash;Capt. Camps and I went to the Court, and
there staid till the Councell entred into themperours pallas, and then
spoake to them for our dispach, which now they have promised us
without feale shall be within 2 or 3 daies. Also Torazemon Dono sent
me two wilduckes for a present, and withall advized me our dispach
would now be shortly.</p>

<p>And, as I am enformed, there will be warrs shortly in Japon betwixt
themperour and his uncle; for themperour sent to hym to com and doe
his obesance, as other subjectes doe, or else he would take his
revenews from hym. But he retorned answer he owed hym noe such
service, and that yf he went about to take his inheritance from hym,
he would defend it by armes. Soe that 10 princes are sent to hym to
turne his mynd; yf not, then warrs will ensue.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 7</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 6</i>).&mdash;Great aboundance of rayne per night, with
an earthquake at 9 a clock at night.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 8</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 7</i>).&mdash;A stiffe gale most parte of day
<!--252.png--><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>
and night
following, which might be accompted a tuffon or harrecano, with
aboundance of rayne all day.</p>

<p>We could doe nothing about procuring our dispach this day, per means
of the tempestious wether.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 9</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 8</i>).&mdash;The Hollanders and we sent our <i>jurebassos</i>
to the Court to get our dispach, but had nothing but feare wordes, as
allwais the like heretofore. Soe I went to Capt. Camps, to take
councell with hym what we were best to doe. And in the meane tyme,
while I was theare, Torazemon Dono, and Stroyemon Dono, our <i>bongew</i>,
came to our lodging. Soe I went and bade them welcom, and they staid
supper with me; and, amongst other speches, Torazemon Dono said it had
byn better for us to have followd the King of Firandos councell, and
kept Capt. Speck heare, which, by meanes of the Comander Johnson and
others, was refuced, and now we saw how matters went forward. Unto
whome I answered that thenglish were not in falt that he went away;
&ldquo;but,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what could Capt. Speck doe heare now (yf he were here)
then Capt. Camps hath donne?&rdquo; Unto which he knew noe other answer but
it was true; yet this Emperour of Japon was not soe easy to be spoaken
with as his father was. Unto which I answered I knew not that, but for
the King Firando he ought to heare us, we refusing all other kinges of
Japon to settel our selves only in his cuntrey, when we might as well
have donne it in another. He used som wordes that by meanes of our
residence in his cuntrey, he was put to much more charges then
heretofore about building fortresses. In fine, I think all will be
nought, the king being a yong man and harkning to yong councell, which
may deceave hym as it did Roboam, King Sollomans sonne. Once I dowbt
this Torazemon Dono is our secret enemie, and I have the like opinion
of Coa Jno., our <i>jurebasso</i>, although he be a very asse, yet he
secretly doth what he can against us.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 11</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 10</i>).&mdash;Torazemon Dono sent for Capt.
<!--253.png--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span>
Camps and
me to com to hym, for that he had something to tell us from Oyen Dono,
themperours secretary. Soe we went to his howse, where we mett
Cacazemon Dono, Stroyemon Dono, and Jentero Donos secretary. And they
tould us that, tuching the priz goodes in the friggot, the Japons said
it was theirs, and not the Spaniardes or Portingales, but themperour
would not beleeve them, for that we had proved them tretors in
bringing padres into Japon, contrary to his comandement. Yet,
notwithstanding, Oyen Dono desired to have our and the Hollanders
<i>jurebassos</i> with Stroyemon Dono, our <i>bongew</i>, to com in private to
hym to morrow, to shew unto hym the truth, what belonged to the
Spaniardes and Portingals and what to the Japons. Soe we agreed upon
it, and withall tould them we never ment to withould anything from the
Japons, and, for the fardells of silk and other matters which the
Japons fathered, there was ticketes in them which shewed to whome they
belonged, and their names written in Spanish and Portugez, all which
we made knowne unto them for their better remembrance to morow. Soe we
had kynd entertaynment and full promis to be dispached within a day or
two without faile, with many complementall wordes both from Cacazemon
Dono and the rest.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 13</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 12</i>).&mdash;Our pilot of Sackay, which brought us
from Firando to Osacky, came to viset me, he coming from Sacky by sea
in a greate bark laden with salte, and was 2 months in the way; and he
sayeth that with the storme few daies past many barkes were cast away
coming in company with hym, and all the people lost, his bark not
escaping without greate danger; this being the 34th voyadg he hath
made from Sacky to this place.</p>

<p>The Hollanders and we sent our <i>jurebassos</i> to Court to get our
dispach; but had nothing but fayre wordes as heretofore, only they
said that themperours Councell receved the King of Fingo this day and
feasted hym, which hindered our dispach, but to morow they would doe
it.</p>

<p><!--254.png--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>
<i class="day">March 14</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 13</i>).&mdash;We sent our <i>jurebassos</i> to Court to
procure our dispach. Soe they had answer that our dispach was granted,
and to morow themperour would send us his present, and then we might
departe when we would.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 15</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 14</i>).&mdash;Capt. Camps and I apointed to morow to
goe to the nobles to take our leave and thank them for our dispach,
and soe to dispach our selves out of Edo.</p>

<p>Also this night, about 10 a clock, was an earthquake, but not of much
contynewance.</p>

<p>And about midnight was a fire in the towne, and much hurleburly.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 16</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 15</i>).&mdash;Capt. Camps and I, with Mr. Osterwick,
went to Torazemon Dono to thank hym for the paines he had taken about
our busynes heare, and withall did deliver unto hym a writing
conserning the abuses offered unto us and our nation at Firando, in
keeping of our men presoners and sending them to Nangasaque to sell
them to our enemis, and make our howse a preson for the Japons,
against whome we had no plito. Unto which he answerd we had reason in
what we said, and that the King of Firando knew nothing thereof, and
therfore all should be amended to our content; and that the presoners
Japons were kept per ordenance of Gonrok Dono, and not per the King of
Firando.</p>

<p>And as Capt. Camps and I were about to goe to thank the nobles for our
dispach, word was brought us we might departe when we would, and leave
som one behind us to receve the present themperour ment to geve us,
for that as yet it was not ready; which truly is the greatest wrong or
indignety that eaver hitherto was offered to any Christians, and I
think is donne of purpose per meanes of the King of Firando, whose
mother is a papisticall Jesuist, and he and the rest of his bretheren
and sisters papisticall Christians. Soe
<!--255.png--><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span>
that I think it is impossible
that we shall eaver have good entertaynment in his cuntrey. God send
me and the rest of our nation well out of it.</p>

<p><i class="day">March 17</i> (<i class="day">Ninguach 16</i>).&mdash;Capt. Camps and my selfe went to the
Emperours Councell to take our leave, viz: to Oyen Dono, Codgque Dono,
Otto Dono, Ita Canusque Dono, the 4 princepall councellors. And we
spoake to Oyen Dono and Ita Canusque Dono, whoe gave us very good
wordes, and said they were ashamed we staid here soe long and that we
had not themperours present delivered to us before we went from hence,
but, yf we tarid 2 or 3 daies longer, it would be ready, or delivered
in our abcense to whome we pleased to receave it, yf we went away
before. But Codgsque Dono and Otto Dono were not at home, but hadd
left order with their secretaries to answer as the former. Soe we went
from thence to the lodging of Gonrok Dono, and carid hym a present
from us and the Hollanders. And Itamia Canusque Dono sent me 2 silke
coates or <i>kerremons</i>, and the like to the Duch.</p>

<p>I tould Capt. Camps I ment to vizet Shongo Dono, the admirall, and
cary hym a present of &#189; a <i>catty</i> of campher and a <i>tay</i>
wight of currall, all at my owne coste, in respect of the frenship
which was betwixt Capt. Adames and hym, and to wish hym to contynew
his favour to his child, now the father was dead. But Capt. Camps fell
into collerik terms, and tould me I could not goe to hym nor non else
without his consent. Unto which I replied I might doe with my owne
what I list, and that I did not put this to the companis acco. Unto
which he answerd that I now went about to procure his disgrace, and to
get all the thanke to my selfe, in respeckt of a present was geven hym
both this yeare as also the last, which had it not byn for thenglish,
they would have given him nothing. Unto which I replied I knew nothing
of that which passed the last yeare, and, for that which was donne
this yeare, he might have chosen whether
<!--256.png--><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span>
he would have geven it or no.
Yet there is suffitient witnesse he said he was sory he had not geven
more in respect of our good entertaynment. But it seemed Capt. Camps
was angry, for he tould me he had put up more indigneties at my hands
then this, which, God is my witnesse, I know not whereby he speaketh
it, for he hath contynewally ensulted over me, and thrust hym selfe
still before me into presence of themperour and his Councell, saying
his place was before myne in respect the Duch was admerall at sea in
the Manillias voyage this yeare. Yet I suffered all this with
pasyence, and let hym take his course; but to be master of my owne and
geve it to whome I list, I think I offerd hym no injury.</p>

<p>Also Oyen Dono, themperours cheefe secretary, brought me 5 silk coates
or <i>kerremons</i> of silk (as I make acco. the Hollanders had the like)
with many complementall wordes; and out of these 5 coates I gave 2 to
Mr. Osterwick, 1 to Robt. Jones and 1 to Jno. Collins at recept
therof.</p>

<p>Also we gave these presentes following in our house:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>


<p class="indent">5 <i>cattis</i> white raw silk to Capt. Adams wyfe.</p>

<p class="p0 indent">1 pec. ditto to Yode Dono, their frend.</p>
<p class="p0 indent">1 pec. red cheremy to Robt. and Jnos. hostis.</p>

<p>We left order with Torazemon Dono to rec. our present from themperour
both for us and Hollanders, as also our petition for themperour; and I
left my <i>goshon</i> with Andreas to get a new one out and send it to me.</p>

February; wherein he writes me all the Japon presoners which were in
our howse are sett at liberty; and that the Hollanders sent our 6
English men ashore againe which weare abord their shipp, being compeld
by Japons. Soe they carid them all to Nangasaque, and Jno. Yoosen hath
them in his handes and will not deliver them unto us, allthough Mr.
Eaton sent Ric. Hudson and a <i>jurebasso</i> with hym to demand them,
offering to pay all the charges he hath disbursed. But he answered
that he would not deliver them, although the King of Firando and
Governor of Nangasaque comanded hym, for that he had mad ready his
junck and ment to send them to the Holland factory at Jaccatra, except
we would buy his junck and pay hym 20,000 <i class="measure">taies</i> he had disbursed in

King of
Faccatais men did misuse our horsmen, after our horses weare entred
into the bark, and would have put them out per force, because we weare
strangers. Whereupon they went together by the eares, and much a doe
there was about it. Soe that the <i>bongew</i> of Faccata sent word it was
donne without his consent, and therefore, yf we brought out the
parties which did it, were they 1, 2, 3, or 4, he would put them to
death in our sight. But our horsmen weare soe bent because the Faccata
men had misused them, they being themperours men, that nothing would
serve them but the death of the others; which I would not consent
unto, but wished them to defer the matter till we came to Miaco, and
then we would bring it to passe before the justis theare. And
Stroyemon Dono, the King of Firandos <i>bongew</i>, was of the same
opinion; yet our horsmen weare not content. But in the end they agreed
among themselves.</p>

<p>The 12th of June we came to an ancor in the haven of Firando, in
Japan, where the kinge of the place receaved us very kyndlie; Mr.
Adams not being theare, but had heard of our coming per meanes of a
letter sent from Sr. Thomas Smith, which caused hym to leave order
with his host to send a post to hym at our coming, which he did, and
our Generall wrot hym 3 severall letters, yet he arived not at Firando
till the 29th of July. And the 7th of August our Generall departed for
the Japan court, Mr. Adams accompanyinge hym. And it was the 6th
November before he did retorne for Firando, it provinge a tediouse
jorney. Yet he obtayned all priveleges that he did demand. God grant
the trade may prove as benefitiall as hetherto our succeadinges have
byn suckcesfull. The only crose hath byn the runinge away of 7 of our
marreners in the abcense of our Generall, viz. John Bowles,
Christopher Evans, Jno. Sars, Clement Lock, and Jno. Totty, Englishe
men, and Jasper Malconty, and one Jaques, Flemyngs; but Bowles and
Evans were the instigators of the rest. They stole away the skiffe and

Phillipinas per the
Jesuistes; but the skiffe we recovered againe.</p>

<p>The Flemynges had setled them selves heare 3 or 4 yeares before our
arivall, and have built them a howse in this place, which hath cost
them allready above 2500<i>l.</i> str.; and doe disperce them selves
abroade, som on way and som an other, to look out for trade, as we
must doe the lyke, for they are close and will let us understande
nothinge. They have som small entrance allready into Corea, per way of
an iland called Tushma, which standeth within sight of Corea and is
frend to the Emperor of Japan. But the chifest place which as yet they
have fownd out is from hence to Syam and Pattania, from whence they
bring silke, brasill wood, and deare skynns, which is all ready money
heare.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams is now entertayned into your Worships servis for a cupell of
yeares, untill news com of the <i>Cloves</i> safe arivall in England,
he being now at libertie to com for his contrey when he will. He wold
not be entertayned under 100<i>l.</i> str. a yeare. The Flemynges did
what they could to have gotten hym from us, which made hym to stand
the more on his pointes. He aledged he was a pore man and that he had
spent 14 yeares allready to noe purpose, and now wold be loth to
retorne for his contrey a begger, gevinge the Worpll. Compa. humbly
thankes for his libertie, which he doth acknowledge came cheefely by
meanes of the coming of this ship with his Maties. letters of England.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams is of the opynion that, yf eaver the northeast or northwest
passages be fownd out, it must be from these partes, and offreth his
best services therein, the Emperour promisinge his best fortherance
with men or letters of recomendacions to all prinses, and hath
entrance allready into an iland called Yedzo, which is thought to be
rather som parte of the continent of Tartaria. Mr. Adams hath drawne
out the plot of Japan, with parte of that iland and Corea and other
bordering places, and sendeth it to your Worships per this conveance.</p>

Yt is certen that the Hollanders had taken this discovery in hand
before now, but that they have soe many irons in the fyre allready
with their wars in the Molucas against the Spaniardes.</p>

<p>I am sory that I canot instantly write your Worships of much benefitt
to be made in these partes; yet I see both the Spaniard, Portingale,
and Duche look out very sharplie about matters of trade. And, yf they
doe good, I hope in tyme we shall doe the lyke, in havinge care and
usinge dilligence, for out of dowbte heare is greate store of silver
in these partes, and, could we gett any greate quantety of broad cloth
to vent, it wold prove a greate matter, allthough at low rates; but as
yet they are soe adicted to silks, that they doe not enter into
consideration of the benefitt of wearinge cloth. But tyme may altar
their myndes, and in the meane tyme we must seeke out other matters
benefitiall, as I have formerly said other men doe; and, for my owne
part, soe long as I stay in these partes (or else where) in your
Worps. service, I will use my best endevour.</p>

<p class="right smaller">January the &emsp;&emsp;, 1613[4], Firando in Japan.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Wickham,&mdash;It being generally agreed upon (with your owne consent)
that yow make a voyage for Edow, Sherongo, and those partes of Japan,
with such a cargezon of goods and merchandiz as I should think
fyttinge, beinge assisted with Capt. Adams, for the better dispaching
your busynes with the Emperour, with whome yow know he
<!--264.png--><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span>
hath good
entrance and no other employments for hym at present; yet, those
matters of the Emperour being past, I pray yow detayne hym not theare,
but will hym to make as much speede as he can back for Firando, where
there will be necessary use of hym.</p>

<p>And being arived in those partes, my opynion is that yow take up your
lodginge in the best merchantes howse in the towne, where yow may have
a gadonge fyrefree, to prevent the danger therof, which is not
unknowne unto yow this cuntrey is much subject unto. And to live under
the roofe of a naturall Japan is better then to be in the howse of any
stranger, be he Duch, Spaniard, Portingall, or of any other nation
whatsoever. And the better mans howse yow lye at, the more creditt it
will be for yow, and the more securetie yow will live in what occation
soeaver happen. I my selfe speake this per experience, as havinge made
proofe thereof. And have an espetiall care not to trust any man with
the Companies goods without makinge ready payment, for I am informed
these cuntrey people are not to be trusted, nether will any marchant
of accompt seeke to bye upon creddit. And for others, they are to be
refused.</p>

<p>And in my opynion it will be your best course to make choise of som
one man in those partes, to assiste yow in makinge choise and
receavinge of your moneyes, a thinge much to be regarded in these
partes per meanes of the greate deceate is used therein. And no dowbt
yow may procure such a one for a small matter. And make much of
frends, when yow have them, and use these cuntrey people kyndly both
in word and deede, for fayre wordes will doe much and as soone are
spoaken as fowle, and allwais good will com thereof; for these cuntrey
people are not to be used nether with bad wordes nor blowes, no not
soe much as servantes entertayned for necessary uses; but rather put
them away, yf they be not to your lykinge, and make choise of others.</p>

<p>And to use any speeches to perswade yow from gamnynge
<!--265.png--><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span>
I thinke it is
needlese; for I hold yow no gamster. Yet, notwithstandinge, the
admonition of a frend is not to be rejected. And, to say the truth,
many inconvenyences happen and fall out per meanes of gamnynge,
although it be but to passe away the tyme for trifles; and therefore
it is not amisse to forsweare gamnynge.</p>

<p>Yt is good to use both Duche, Spaniardes, and Portingalls kyndly, as
also all other strangers; and learne from them what yow can, but make
them not partakers of your secretes or pretenses.</p>

<p>And for sales or dispach of your comodeties, I know yow will use your
best endevour for our employers benefits; and therefore I will sett
yow no stynted rate or price, but wishe yow to sell away as tyme shall
serve at all prises, to turne all into ready money, before any other
shipinge com out of England, that it may not be said we lye still and
doe nothinge but eate and drink without takinge care for any thinge. I
hope yow will not let the Duch goe beyonde yow in this poynt.</p>

<p>Yow know that as yet we have not sould our English cloth under eight
<i class="measure">taies</i> the English yard, and cloth of Cambaia under fowre for one
profitt; but stand yow not upon that matter, but sell away both the
one and other as yow can, as also gunpolder, allthough it be under
twentie <i class="measure">taies</i> the barell, which is loe price. Yet yow must consider
it is a dangerouse comodetie to be kept, and therfore make dispach.
Once use your best endevour both for that and the rest, as afforsaid,
etc.</p>

<p>And for the two parcelles of comodeties left in the custody of
Andreas, alias Gendoque Dono, of Uringo, and Quedoquea Stibio Dono,
att Edow and Shrongo, yow are to take acco. of it beinge parte of your
cargezon.</p>

<p>And yf Tome Same, the yonge Kynge of Firando, com unto yow with a note
or remembrance of my hand, to lend hym one thousand <i class="measure">tais</i> or more, as
Capt. Adams will
<!--266.png--><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span>
advize yow, I pray yow take in my note and let hym
have the money, in gevinge yow a bill of his hand to repay it me heare
againe in Firando at demand; which Capt. Adams tells me I need not to
stand in dowbt of, for that the Duch have doone the lyke heretofore
and have receaved good payment. But this must be doone when yow have
receaved money of the Emperour.</p>

<p>And, havinge any overplus of that money lyinge by yow or that is
receaved for any other comodetie, use your best endevour to send it to
me per first sure conveance (which I think will be per Capt. Adams),
that it may not be dead, but be emploied to the Companies use as
occation shall be offred.</p>

<p>And for your dyet or such as shall be with yow, I will not prescribe
yow any rate, because I am unaccoynted with the place; but leave that
to your owne discretion, not dowbtinge but yow will use frugallitie,
etc.</p>

<p>And because yow are to goe overland from Osekey to Shrongo in company
of Capt. Adams about the Emperours busynes, and that it is fytt som
one of trust goe in the bark with the rest of the goods per sea for
that place, I have thought good to send Jno. Phebie with it, a man
well knowne to Capt. Adams, whome yow may entertayne theare as the
Companies servant under yow, yf yow fynde hym capeable or that it be
fytinge.</p>

<p>And forget not to write me per all conveances what yow doe, and learne
out what yow can tuchinge trade into any place we yet know not of.
And, God willing, yow shall not want to heare from me soe often as I
fynd fit conveance. And it is good yow write contynewally to Mr. Eaton
for Osekey, as I have willed hym to doe the lyke to yow; for soe may
we from tyme to tyme understand of each others proceadings, and I be
ready to supplie your wantes with such comodeties as lye by me, yf in
case yow can sell them yow have theare.</p>

<p>And for a <i>jurebasso</i>, yf he which promised yow com from
<!--267.png--><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>
Langasaque,
yow shall have hym with yow, otherwais yow must get one at Edow or
Shrongo; and in the meane tyme Capt. Adams hath promised me that
Andreas shall helpe yow, and tells me that yow canot want to fynd one
there to your content.</p>

<p>I know not what else to advize yow of for present, but, yf any thinge
com to my remembrance heareafter, yow shall understand thereof per
first. And soe the Lord send yow a prosperouse voyage and safely to
retorne. Amen.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Wickham,&mdash;By George the Portingall (whoe departed from hence the
9th ultimo) I wrot yow severall letters, advisinge for the present;
since which time I have recd. 2 letters from Mr. Eaton of the 1th and
13th ultimo, wherin he hath adviseth me he hath sould all his white
baftas at sixteene <i>mas</i> the peece, and certen mattes broad cloth
at fyfteene <i class="measure">taies</i> the matt. I wish all the rest were gon at
same or lyke rate, both that I have here and others else where. He
<!--268.png--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 264]</span>
sayeth that som of his comodeties they will not look at, namely,
selas, blew byrams, and candequis maweey. Once doe what yow can to
sell away, allthough somthinge under cento per cento, for it is better
to have money by us then comodeties, whatsoever shall happen; for here
are many reportes geven out of trubles lyke to ensue in Japan. But
kepe that to your selfe, and learne out what yow can and advize me
thereof per first sure conveance.</p>

<p>I make acco. Capt. Adams will be com away before this com to your
handes, otherwaies geve hym counsell to take heed of one Pedro Guzano,
a papist Christian, whoe is his hoste at Miaco; for a lyinge fryre (or
Jesuist) tould Mr. Peacock at Langasaque that Capt. Adams was dead in
the howse of the said Guzano, which now I know is a lye per letters I
receved from Mr. Eaton, for the said fryre rep[orted] he was dead
before the date thereof. Once I wold wish Capt. Adams to looke to hym
selfe, for these villanose papisticall rable at Langasaque doe geve it
out behinde his back that he is a Lutrano and one that they make
accompt hath incensed the Emperoure against them. I wish Capt. Adams
at his being here to looke to hym selfe and take heed of them. And soe
would I wish yow to do the lyke.</p>

<p>Mr. Peacock departed from Langasaque towardes Cochinchina the 18th
ultimo, as he advized me in a letter of that date, written from abord
the jonke he goeth in called the <i>Roquan</i>. We have had much
northerly windes since their departure, soe I dowbt not but they will
have a spedie passage, which God grant them with a prosperouse voyage.</p>

<p>Upon som occation I have noted that yow may esteeme I love yow not, or
that I beare som secret grudge against yow, which here I doe protest
(before God) I doe not, but rather doe esteeme much better of yow
since your cominge hether then I did before. And soe shall yow find by
proofe, yf it lye in my power to do yow good; for I regard not, but
rather have quite put out of my memory, any wordes which have passed
betwixt us hereto[fore].</p>

<p><!--269.png--><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 265]</span>
I wish yow could make dispache of your busynese to be here ag[ainst]
the Syam voyage, and then shall yow see what I will doe. And tru[lye]
I wold not wish yow to stay there upon small occations, but rather to
leave them with your host or some other good frend that is assured.
And in the meane tyme sell away what yow can; stand not upon price,
but turne what yow can into money and bringe it alonge with yow. I can
say no more nor geve yow no larger comition then I have doone. And
soe, with my hartie comendacons to your selfe, Sr. Andrea, and the
rest of our accoyntance, I comyt yow to God, restinge allwais your

Company our broad cloth was not vented this

ours; which yf it soe fall out, yow may easely gese what a skandall it
will be unto us, ours departinge hence soe many monethes before it. I

<p>With greefe of mynd I write unto yow of the ill hap and death of our
frend Mr. Tempest Peacock in Cochinchina, where he arived in saffetie,
as the Duch did the lyke, and sould their goods to the kinge, whoe
gave order they should com to his cittie of Miaco to receave payment,
but forestald them and sett upon them in their retorne and kild all
that was in company, both Duch, English, and Japans their followers.
But, as it is reported, Walter Carwarden was left abord the jonck and
soe escaped; yet serche was made there for hym, and whether he be
alive or dead, God He knoweth, or what parte of our comodetie was left
abord the jonk, for out of dowbt Walter was not left there for
nothing. And amongst the rest they had a thousand <i>pezos</i> in
rialls of 8, which I am assured was not ashore. Their cargezon did
amount to above seaven hundred twentie and eight pownd str., as it
cost first peny. It is thought that the Kynge of Cochinchina did this
in revenge of som injuries offered hym per the Duch certen yeares
past. God grant Walter may escape, and then I dowbt not but a good
parte of our goodes will be retorned.</p>

and bringeth newes that aboove 20 seale of Hollanders are com thether
from the Moloucas, amongst whome are 2 or 3 saile of English ships;

Yf this be true, out of dowbt it goeth ill with the Spaniardes in the

<p>The Emperour of Japan hath banished all Jesuistes, pristes, friers,
and nuns out of all his domynions, som being gon for the Phillippinas
and the rest for Amacou in China. Yt is thought wars will ensue in
Japan betwixt the Emperour and Fidaia Same, sonne to Ticus Same, the
deceased Emperour.</p>

<p>We cannot per any meanes get trade as yet from Tushma into Corea,
nether have them of Tushma any other privelege but to enter into one
littell towne (or fortresse), and in paine of death not to goe without
the walles thereof to the landward; and yet the King of Tushma is no
subject to the Emperour of Japan. I am geven to understand that up in
the cuntrey of Corea they have greate citties and betwixt that and the
sea mightie boggs, soe that no man can travell on horseback nor very
hardlie on foote. But, for remedie against that, they have invented
greate waggons or carts which goe upon broad flat whiles under seale,
as shipps doe; soe that, observing monsons, they transport their
goodes to and fro in thease sealing waggons. They have damasks,
sattens, taffetes, and other silke stuffs made theare as well as in
China. It is said that Ticus Same, otherwaies called Quabicondono (the
deceased Emperour), did pretend to have convayed a greate armie in
thease sealing waggons, to have assealed the Emperour of China on a
sudden in his greate cittie of Paquin, where he is ordenarely
rezident; but he was prevented by a Corean noble man whoe

<p class="right smaller">Firando in Japan, le 5th of December, 1615.</p>

<p class="p2">Loveing frendes,&mdash;Wishing your welfare, etc. After a tedious passage
and almost out of hope to obtaine my appointed porte (by reason of the
latenes of the monsoone), it pleased God (praysed be His name) to
bringe me, with men, shipp, and goodes, in safety unto Firando upon
the 4th September past, where I found Captaine Adames returned and his
juncke in trimminge a new. He putt not into China, as was reported,
but into the iland called Leque Grande, where he was indifferentlie
entreated, but could not be suffered to repayre his junck as he
desired, beinge forced onelie to stay for the monsone to bringe him
backe againe hither.</p>

<p>Upon the 11th September I departed from hence towardes the Emperours
court with a present (which every shipp or juncke that cometh hither
must of force performe), which with charges much surmounteth an
indifferent custome, espetially when a shipp cometh with a small
capitall, and sales soe base and slacke that nothinge is here to be
expected but losse, except a trade be procured into China, the raw
silkes of which cuntrey are alwaies here reddy mony and reasonable
profitt. Ether, I say, we must procure a peaceable trade in China, or
elles, as the Hollanders doe, to trade with them perforce. And, yf wee
sett foote in the Moluccoes, this place will be a fitt storehouse from
whence we may alwaies have men, munition, and victualles good store
and at
<!--276.png--><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</span>
reasonable rates; for which purpose principally the Hollanders
doe mentaine this factory.</p>

<p>The Portingalles are quite out of favour with the Emperor. They
attended 40 daies at the Emperors court to deliver theire present,
which at last was recd., but none of them admitted to his presence. It
is thought that they will com noe more hither with any greate shippes
from Amacon.</p>

<p>Certaine Jesuites came out of Nova Espania in embassage unto the
Emperor, with a letter and a present from the King of Spaine, which,
after a moneth or 6 weekes attendance, the Emperor recd., but none of
the embassadors admitted to his presence. All the answer to their
embassage was, to gett them foorth of this cuntry with speede, upon
paine of his displeasure.</p>

<p>His cuntry is now in peace, for that the old Emperor hath made an
absolute conquest, haveinge driven the young king quite out of this
cuntry and made away most of his principall partakers.</p>

<p>Capt. Cock is of opinion that the ginghams, both white and browne,
which yow sent will prove a good commodity in the Kinge of Shashma his
cuntry, who is a kinge of certaine of the most westermost ilandes of
Japon, a man of greate power and hath conquered the ilandes called the
Leques, which not long since weare under the governement of China.
Leque Grande yeeldeth greate store of amber greece of the best sorte,
and will vent 1,000 or 15,000 (<i>sic</i>) ps. of course cloth, as
dutties and such like, per annum. At my being at the Emperor, I
procured his letters unto the King of Shashma, to graunt us as free
liberties of trade in the Leques and all other his dominions as we had
in any other parte of Japon; and in February Mr. Richard Wickham is to
goe thither, and (priviledges obtained accordinge to the Emperors
order) to remaine there.</p>

for they have greate store of silkes and linnen stuffes made here
better and cheaper then we can afford our India cloth. Soe that we
must strive to procure strange sortes of cloth with strange

it for good prize, both men and goods, and that either we or they may
take them or Spaniardes at sea and make good purchesse thereof, except
they have the Emperours passe.</p>

<p>Also yow may understand how a shipp arived at Quanto in Japon this

cloth, kersies, perpetuanos, and raz de Millan, which they offer at a
loe rate; but I thinke it is the last that ever will be brought from
thence, for it is said the Spaniardes made proclemation with 8 drums
at Aguapulca and other partes that, upon payne of death, their should
neaver any more Japons com nor trade into New Spayne, and that both
they and all other strangers of what nation soever should forthwith
avoid out of all partes of New Spaine. But in requitall hereof the
Emperour of Japon hath made proclemation, in payne of death, that
neaver hereafter any Japon shall trade or goe into New Spaine, and

life, with the] slaughter of above
100,000 men which took his [parte. Some] report he was burned in his
castell, it being fired; others think he escaped and is in Shashma or
the Liqueas. His mother cut her owne belly, and his littell childe was
executed by comand from the Emperour, as also all others were the lyke
which were knowne to take parte with hym. And Osakay and Sackay, two
greate citties, burned to the grownd, not soe much as one howse being
saved; your Worps. loosing goodes which were burned to the vallu of

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>[And may it plea]se your Worps. to understand that the last yeare [it
was agreed for a certe]n Italion marrener to goe in our junck for Syam
[whose name is] Damian Marina, and an other Castalliano called Jno.
[de Lievana] went with hym. Which coming to the knowledg of the
Portingales and Spaniardes at Langasaque, that they had served the
English, they laid handes on them and carid them presoners abord the
great shipp of Amacan. The which being made knowen unto me, I wrot a
letter to the capitan major of the ship, willing hym to set them at
liberty, for that they were not under his comand nor jurisdiction, but
under the English; and to the lyke effect I wrot an other letter to
Gonrocq Dono, cheefe governor at Langasaque for the Emperour; but had
a scornfull answer from the Portingale, and nothing but words from the
Japon. Whereupon I got a letter testimoniall from the King of Firando
to the Emperour, how these 2 men were entertayned into service of the
English; and Mr. Wm. Adams being above with Capt. Ralph Coppendalle to
carry a [present to] the Emperour, gave hym to understand of this
matter, [and he gave] his command forthwith that the 2 men should be
[set at liberty] and all their goodes restored to them. Which was
[accordingly
<!--280.png--><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span>
accomp]lished to the greate harts greefe both of [the
Spaniardes and Port]ingale, they haveing condemned them both [to
death] and sent pristes to confesse them and exhibited [articles]
against them to Gonrock Dono, as against traitors [to their owne]
cuntry and frendes to the English and Hollanders their enemies. Which
processe the capt. major deliverd both in Japons and Portugese with
his ferme at it; but that in Portugese Gonrocq Dono sent to the King
of Firando, and he gave it unto me, which here inclozed I send unto
your Wor., together with his letter written to me, in which is
manifested that they hould both English and Duch for their enemies.</p>

<p>But that which vexeth them the most is that the Hollanders tooke a
Portingale junck on the cost of Japon laden with ebony wood, the
greatest parte, with tynne and serten bars of gould and much conservs.
Which junck with all that was in it, men and all, the Emperour aloweth
for good prize; and is [to] be thought that Mr. Wm. Adames was a
cheefe occation to move the Emperour thereunto, he first asking Mr.
Adames wherefore [there was] such hatred betwixt the Spaniardes and
Hollanders, for [that it w]as tould hym their princese and governors
were [frendes in all] other partes of the world, and that it seemed
strange [to hym that they] should be enemies heare. Unto which Mr.
Adames answerd that it was true they [had been] frendes of late yeares
per meanes of the Kinge [of England] and other potentates; but yet,
notwithstanding, [the Kinge of] Spaine did think hym selfe to have
more right [in these] partes of the world then any other Christian
prince, by [reason] of the footing he had gotten in the Phillippinas
and in other partes of the Indies, and therefor per force ment to
keepe all other nations from trading into these partes. Unto which the
Emperour replied and said, the Spaniard had no reason, and therefore,
seeing it was a differance or dispute amongst us which were all
strangers, he would not make
<!--281.png--><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</span>
nor meddell in the matter, but leave
it to their princes to decide at home. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is the
occation they take men as well as goods?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because (said Mr. Adames)
the Spaniardes take the Hollanders and have 150 or 200 of them
presoners in the Phillipi[nas, for] which occation the Hollanders doe
use the lyke [towards] their people, man for man and goodes for
goodes.&rdquo; [Unto which] the Emperour answerd that they had [reason].</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>[Mr. Adames tould me that the] Emperour gave hym councell not [to
seale in Japon] joncks on noe voyage, but rather stay in [Japon, and
that] yf the stipend he had geven hym were not [enough] he would geve
hym more. But he answerd his [word was] passed, and therefore, yf he
performed not his w[ord, it would] be a dishonor unto hym. Yet truly,
at his retorne to Firando, I offred to have quit hym of his promis and
to have sent hym to Edo to be neare the Emperour upon all occations.
Yet would he not be perswaded thereunto. But the Emperour esteemeth
hym much, and he may goe and speake with hym at all tymes, when kyngs
and princes are kept out.</p>

me to certifie your Wor. that he thought 100<i>l.</i> very littell,

willed me to desyre your Wor. to let his wife have [30 or 40 powndes]

<p class="p2">Many report that the Emperor is dead, but the report from most of
credit saye he is recovered and in resonabel good health. He hath
bestowed great presents upon the chefe nobylity whome he hath
despatched very honorably for theyr contery. Shimash Dono came
yesterday to Fuxame, and will be imbarked within this 4 daies at
furdest from Osacay. Frushma Tayo Dono came to Meaco 4 dayes since,
having leave to goe for his contery after 5 yeares attendance at the
court. He is much honored heare in these parts. Shongo Sama is
departed from Serongaue 23 dayes since for Eado, and it is said that
he will come and visit his douory in Meaco in June or July next.
During the Emperors sicknes he caused his chefe phesition to be cut in
peces for telling him, being asked by the Emperor why he
<!--283.png--><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span>
could not
soner cure him, that in regard he was an ould man his medesen could
not worke so efectualy upon his body as apon a yong man. Wheareupon
without saying any more to him commanded Cogioodon to cause him to be
bound and cut in peces. Upon the which Ximas Dono sent him his
phesition, the China, who did him much good, as it is reported; which
maketh me thinck that the Emperor is living by reason Ximas Dono his
peopell doe report. You may be sure the China would not kepe any such
secret from his master Ximas Dono, yet nether Ximas Dono nor Tozo Dono
nor any nobel man since the going up hath sene the Emperor, nether of
his Counsell hath any this many dayes bene admited to his presents,
there being none but Cogi Dono, 2 weomen, and 2 phesitions sufered to
com in his sight, which maketh many to suspect that he is dead, as
they saye it is the maner to conceale the death of the Emperor a whole
yeare or more before it be knowne publik.</p>

<p>May it please your Wors. to understand that, these 2 shipps [the
<i class="shipname">Thomas</i> and the <i class="shipname">Advice</i>] being arived at Firando in Japon and Mr.
Jno. Baylie being very sick, wherof he shortly after died, it was
generally thought fit that I made a journey to the court of the new
Emperour Shungo Samme, to renew our privelegese (as the Hollanders
ment to do the lyke), in which voyage I was 4 monethes and 5 daies
before I retorned to Firando, and the Hollanders are not yet retorned.
Yet the 5th day after I arived at court our present was deliverd, and
had audience with many favorable wordes, but could not get my dispach
in above a month
<!--284.png--><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 280]</span>
after; so that once I thought we should have lost
all our privelegese, for the Councell sent unto us I think above
twenty tymes to know whether the English nation were Christians or no.
I answerd we were, and that they knew that before by our Kinges
Maties. letter sent to the Emperour his father (and hym selfe),
wherein it apeared he was defender of the Christian faith. &ldquo;But&rdquo;, said
they, &ldquo;are not the Jesuists and fryres Christians two?&rdquo; Unto which I
answerd they were, but not such as we were, for that all Jesuists and
fryres were banished out of England before I was borne, the English
nation not houlding with the pope nor his doctryne, whose followers
these padres (as they cald them) weare. Yt is strang to see how often
they sent to me about this matter, and in the end gave us waynyng that
we did not comunecate, confesse, nor baptiz with them, for then they
should hold us to be all of one sect. Unto which I replied that their
Honours needed not to stand in dowbt of any such matter, for that was
not the custom of our nation.</p>

<p>Soe, in the end, they gave me our new privelegese with the Emperours
ferme, telling me they were conformable to the former. So herewith I
departed, and, being 2 daies journey on my way, met an expres from Mr.
Wickham, wherin he wrot me from Miaco that the justice (per the
Emperours comand) had geven order that all strangers should be sent
downe to Firando or Langasaque, and forthwith departe and carry all
their merchandiz with them and not stay to sell any, so that he was
forced to keepe within howse, and our hostes durst sell nothing. Which
news from Mr. Wickham seemed very strang unto me. Whereupon I sought
one to read over our privelegise, which with much a do at last I fownd
a <i>boz</i> (or pagon prist) which did it, and was that we were
restrayned to have our shiping to goe to no other place in Japon but
Firando, and there to make sales. Whereupon I retorned back againe to
the
<!--285.png--><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>
court, where I staid 18 or 20 daies more, still suing and puting
up suplecations to have our privelegese enlarged as before, aledging
that yf it were not soe, that my soveraigne lord King James would
think it to be our misbehaviours that cauced our privelegese to be
taken from us, they having so lately before byn geven us by his Matis.
father of famous memory, and that it stood me upon as much as my life
was worth to get it amended, otherwais I knew not how to shew my face
in England. Yet, for all this, I could get nothing but wordes.
Whereupon I desyred to have the ould privelegese retorned and to
render back the new, with condition they would geve us 3 yeares
respite to write into England and have answer whether our Kinges
Matie. would be content our privelegese should be so shortned or no.
Yet they would not grant me that. And then I desird we might have
leave to sell such merchandiz as we had now at Miaco, Osakay, Sackay,
and Edo; otherwais I knew not what to do, in respect Firando was but a
fysher towne, haveing no marchantes dwelling in it, and that it was
tyme now to send back our shipps and junckes, and nothing yet sould.
Yet this I could not have granted nether. So that with much a doe in
the end they gave me leave, as I past, to sell my goodes to any one
would presently buy it, or else leave it to be sould with any Japon I
thought good to trust with it. Which restrant hath much hindered our
sales and put me to my shiftes, the rather for that the order of Japon
is that no stranger may sell any thing at arivall of their shipps till
it be knowne what the Emperour will take; so that it is allwais above
a month or 6 wickes before a post can run to and fro to have lycence.</p>

<p>And at my coming away Oyen Dono and Codsquin Dono, the Emperours
secretarys, tould me that they were sory they could not remedy this
matter of our privelegese at present, the reason being for that an
Emperours edict per act of parliament being soe lately set out could
not so sowne
<!--286.png--><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span>
be recalled without scandalle, but the next yeare, yf
I renewed my sute, my demandes being so substantiated, they did verely
think it might be amended, in respect Firando was well knowne to be
but a fisher towne. So that I aledged the Emperour might as well take
away all our privelegese and banish us out of Japon as to shut us up
in such a corner as Firando, where no marchantes dwell. But I hope the
next yeare, when Generall Keeling cometh, it may be amended; otherwais
I feare me our Japon trade will not be worth the looking after.</p>

<p>And it is to be noted that at my retorne to Miaco, haveing donne such
busynes as I had theare, I would have left Richard Hudson, a boy, your
Wor. servant, to have learnd to write the Japans; but might not be
suffered to doe it, the Emperour haveing geven order to the contrary.
Soe we withdrew all our factors from Edo, Miaco, Osakay, and Sackay to
Firando.</p>

<p>The fathers which came in the shipp from Aguapulca brought a present
from the King of Spaine to the Emperour; but, after he had kept it
halfe a yeare, he retorned it back, not reserving any thing, but bad
them be gon.</p>

<p>And I had allmost forgotten to adviz your Wors. of a Spaniard, which
was at the Emperours court at Edo when I was theare. He went out of a
ship of theirs from Xaxma, where 2 greate shipps of theirs arived out
of New Spaine, bound, as they said, for the Phillippinas, but driven
into that place per contrary wynd, both shipps being full of
souldiers, with greate store of treasure, as it is said, above 5
millions of <i>pezos</i>. Soe they sent this man to kis the Emperours
hand; but he never might be suffered to com in his sight, allthough he
staid theare above a month; which vexed hym to see we had axcesse to
the Emperour and he could not. So that he gave it out that our shipps
and the Hollanders which were at Firando had taken and robbed all the
China juncks, which was the occation that very few
<!--287.png--><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 283]</span>
or non came into
Japon this yeare. And som greate men in the court did not want to aske
me the question whether it were true or no, Mr. Wm. Adames being
present. Which we gave them to understand that, concernynge the
Englishe, it was most falce. And withall I enformed the two
secretaries, Oyen Dono and Codsquin Dono, that, yf they lookt out well
about these 2 Spanish shipps arived in Xaxma full of men and treasure,
they would fynd that they were sent of purpose by the King of Spaine,
haveing knowledg of the death of the ould Emperour, thinking som
papisticall tono might rise and rebell and so draw all the papistes to
flock to them and take part, by which meanes they might on a sudden
seaz upon som strong place and keepe it till more succors came, they
not wanting money nor men for thackomplishing such a strattagim. Which
speeches of myne wrought so far that the Emperour sent to stay them,
and, had not the greate shipp cut her cable in the howse so to escape,
she had byn arested, yet with her hast she left som of her men behind;
and the other shipp being of som 300 tons was cast away in a storme
and driven on shore, but all the people saved. So in this sort I crid
quittance with the Spaniardes for geveing out falce reportes of us,
yet since verely thought to be true which I reported of them.</p>

<p>Also may it please your Wors. that, at our being at themperours court,
the amerall of the sea was very ernest with Mr. Wm. Adames to have byn
pilot of a voyage they pretended to the northward to make conquest of
certen ilands, as he said, rich in gould; but Mr. Adames exskewced hym
selfe in that he was in your Wors. service and soe put hym afe. And as
I am enformed, they verely think that our pretence to discover to the
northward is to fynd out som such rich ilandes and not for any
passage. Yet I tould the admerall to the contrary, and tould hym that
my opinion was he might doe better to put it into the Emperours mynd
to make a conquest of the Manillias and drive those small
<!--288.png--><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]</span>
crew of
Spaniardes from thence, it being so neare unto Japon; they haveing
conquered the Liqueas allready. He was not unwilling to listen
heareunto, and said he would comunecate the matter to the Emperour.
And out of dowbt yt would be an easy matter for the Emperour to doe
it, yf he take it in hand, and a good occation to set the Japons
heades awork, to put the remembrance of Ticus Samme and his sonne
Fidaia Samme, so lately slaine and disinhereted, out of their minds.</p>

<p>And tuching my former opinion of procuring trade into China, I am
still of the same mynd. And, had it not byn for the greate wars
betwixt the Tartars and them the last yeare, which cauced the Emperour
of China to goe into the northermost partes of his kyngdom to
withstand them, otherwais we had had news of entrance before now. Yet,
notwithstanding, the Chinas which have the matter in hand have sent an
expres about it againe, and caused two letters to be written in China
(as from me) with my ferme at them, with two others in English from me
to same effect, only for fation sake, because they might see my ferme
was all one, the one letter being directed: To the mighty and
powrefull Lord Fiokew, Secretary of Estate to the high and mightie
Prince, the Emperour of China, manifesting that I had geven two
hundred <i class="measure">tais</i> to the bearer thereof, his Lo. servant, to buy hym
necessaries in the way, hoping to receve som good news shortly from
his Lo. of our entrance into China, with other complementall wordes,
as the Chinas wisht me put downe. And the other letter was directed:
To the greate and powrefull Lord Ticham Shafno, Councellor of Estate
to the high and mighty Prince, the Emperour of China, also making
relasion of ten greate bars Oban gould, amonting to 550 <i class="measure">tais</i>
Japon plate, deliverd to the said bearer to carry to hym as a toaken
or small remembrance of my good will, hoping to heare som good news
from hym, as in the other. But both the 10 bars gould and 200
<i class="measure">tais</i>
<!--289.png--><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 285]</span>
silver are sent from the China Capt. to them, yet put downe
in my name, as yf it came from me. In fine, these Chinas tell me that
undowbtedly it will take effect, and the sowner yf the Portingales be
sent from Macau this yeare, as they have adviz they shall. But,
howsoever, these men follow the matter hardly, and tell me that the
Emperour of China hath sent espies into all partes where the
Spaniardes, Portingales, Hollanders, and we do trade, in these partes
of the world, only to see our behaveours on towardes an other, as also
how we behave our selves towardes strangers, especially towardes
Chinas. And som have byn in this place and brought by our frendes to
the English howse, where I used them in the best sort I could, as I
have advized to Bantam, Pattania, and Syam to doe the lyke to all
Chinas.</p>

<p>Also may it please your Worships to understand that, since my retorne
from the Japon cort, there came a mestisa Indian to me, which went to
Cochinchina from Japon in the same junck which Mr. Peacock and Walter
Carwarden went in, and sayeth the reportes are falce which are geven
out against Mr. Peacockes host, that he set upon hym in the way to
slay hym and the Duch, but rather that the matter hapned by meare
chance, his said host being in the boate with hym when it was
overthrowne, and escaped hardly ashore with swyming, being taken up
halfe dead and hardly recovered health in a moneth after; and that Mr.
Peacock carid 50 or 60 R. of 8 along with hym in his pocket, which was
the occation of his drownyng, as apeard som dayes after when his body
was fownd per Walter Carwarden (this mestisa accompanying hym) whoe
fownd the said R. 8 in his pocket, and after gave his body buriall.
And that Walter Carwarden staid in Cochinchina above a month after,
before he imbarked hym selfe to retorne for Japon, the monson being
past. So that, Mr. Peacock being dead and Walter Carwarden gon without
going up to the court
<!--290.png--><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span>
to receave the monies which the kyng owed for
merchandiz bought, that the kyng took occation to write Safian Dono,
governor at Langasaque under the Emperour of Japon, to signefie unto
hym of the death of the one Englishman and departure of the other, so
that, yf an Englishman would com and receve the money he owed, he was
ready to pay it. But the junck which brought that letter for Safian
Dono was cast away, as well as that wherin Water Carwarden came, so
that we never heard news of them.</p>

<p>The boate wherein Mr. Peacock and the Hollanders were in was overset,
or rather steamed, by another bigger boate runing against them on a
sudden in turnyng at a corner, the other coming on a sudden upon them
from behind a point of land, being under seale and haveing the currant
with her; so that they had no meanes to avoid them, but were presently
sunck downe and, the currant being swift, very few were saved, his
host, a Japon, being one.</p>

<p>I did what I could at my being at Edo to have procured the Emperours
letter to the Kyng of Cochinchina in our behalfe, to have had
restetution of such marchandiz he had bought, in respect we lived in
Japon under his protection and that our goodes went in a Japon junck
under his chape or pase; yet, doe what I could, he denid his letter,
saying he would not medell in other mens matters, nether be behoulden
to the King of Cochinchina for it. But now, coming to knowledg of
these matters and seeing Capt. Adames to have bought a junck, going
hym selfe for pilot in her, I have written to Safian Dono to let us
have his letter of favour to the King of Cochinchina, to send som
small adventure with hym. And Edmond Sayer is very desirous to goe
along with Mr. Wm. Adames; but as yet the adventure is not determined
upon. God send it good suckcesse.</p>

from Cape Bona Speranza; but it proveth here worth nothing, it being

had in comune mens handes, for that all is taken up for the Emperour
by the Kyng of Tushma, whome only hath lycense to trade with the
Coreans, and all the tribute he payeth to the Emperour is of this
rowte. Yt is helde heare for the most pretious thing for phisick that

Emperour of China withall then a tree of currall, ether white or red.
They say the Portingales of Macau gave a white corrall tree to the
Emperour of China many yeares past, which he doth esteem one of the
ruchest jewells he hath. Also they say that earelings or jewelles to
hang in hattes, that are greate pearls and of an orient culler, are
esteemed much in China. And som very greate looking glasses and fyne
Semian chowters and white baftas are good for presentes, with som guns
well damasked, but not soe hevie as these are which ordenarely are
sent; and som dagges or pistalls, som short and others more longer.</p>

<p>The three peeces currall your Wors. sent for a triall were disposed of
as followeth, viz. 1 branch containing 1 <i class="measure">ta.</i> 1 <i>ma.</i> 5 <i>co.</i>, and 1

it. But that they denid to doe, telling me that we might content our
selves with such composition as other men had, or, yf we did not lyke
it, might retorne to our cuntrey yf we pleased. So now I stay only to
get out our two <i>goshons</i> for Syam and Cochinchina, and to get a
dispach from themperour, which will be 3 or 4 daies before I think it
will be ended. And then will I goe for Miaco to se yf we can doe any
good for sales. And then will I for Osakay and Sackay and look out for
the like, to se if I can procure plate to bring downe with me;
otherwais it will be late to send it per the shipp. I think it will be
15 or 20 daies hence before I shall be ready to set from Osakay
towardes Firando. So that, in the meane tyme, use your best endevour
to make sales of such merchandiz as are belo; and stand not upon small
matters to make ready money.</p>

<p>Yt were good, yf yow can, to receve the lead money in melted or
<i>somo</i> plate, donne by a rendador, with themperours stampe upon
it, for then will it passe in saffetie. Or yt were better yf yow could
get it molten into bars lyke tyn bars, but of halfe the length, and of
the just goodnes with rialles of eight; for soe am I advised from
Bantam.</p>

<p>I went thother day to Miaco to have vizeted the Corean

with a present; but the <i class="title">Tono</i> of Tushma would not
let me have accesse unto them. So I turned back to Fushamy.</p>

<p>The <i class="title">Tono</i> of Xaxma, with them of Goto and Umbra, had leave to retorne
to their cuntres 2 or 3 daies past; but the <i class="title">Tono</i> of Firando cannot
be permitted as yet, although he be very ill at ease.</p>

<p>The ould <i>dire</i> died som 8 or 10 daies past. But nether he nor his
sonne, which now is <i>daire</i>, will geve themperour the name or title he
soe much desireth; which geveth hym much discontent, as also the death
of one of his sisters whoe was marid to a greate man not far from
hence and died the other day.</p>

<p>The castell of Osakay must be new builded, with a pagod neare unto
Sackay, which weare destroied in these last wars; and all at
themperours owne cost. Only the westarne <i class="title">tonos</i> must furnish men; but
themperour will pay them, and not put any enhabetant to trowble about
the doing thereof.</p>

<p>Themperour hath geven greate presentes to the Coreans, as all the

 This early use of the proverbial &ldquo;Hobson&rsquo;s choice&rdquo; is
 almost conclusive against the usual explanation of the phrase,
 that it was derived from the method adopted by Hobson, the
 Cambridge carrier, in serving his customers with horses. Hobson
 was born in 1544 and died in 1630. Granting that the expression
 arose during his life-time, it could hardly have begun to pass
 into common usage before the close of the sixteenth century; and
 in those days such popular phrases were not communicated so fast
 as in ours. But here we find Cocks using it as early as 1617,
 after an absence of some years from England; and he would hardly
 have picked it up abroad. Again, Cocks was not a young man; and,
 as a rule, proverbs are learned and become part of our
 vocabulary in youth. &ldquo;Hobson&rsquo;s choice&rdquo; (or Hodgson&rsquo;s, as Cocks
 writes it) may very well have been an older popular saying which
 was applied to the Cambridge carrier&rsquo;s stable arrangements from
 the mere accident of his bearing the name he did.</p>

as other men did and according to the custom of the cuntrey, and carid
a cargezon goodes with hym.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Edmond Sayer retorned ... having donne his best endevour, with the
assistance of Mr. Wm. Adames, to learne out the truth of Mr. Peacockes
death. And fynd that he was murthered by a Japon, his host, with the
consent of one or two of the cheefest men about the kyng, and, as it
is said, the yong prince was of their councell, but the ould kyng
knoweth nothing thereof but that he was cast away by mere chance or
misfortune. These greate men and his host shared all the goodes and
money amongst them, as well of the Hollanders as thenglish whome were
slaine all together in one small boate, it being steamed or oversett
with a greater full of armed men. They are enformed that Mr. Peacockes
ill behaveor was partly occation; for at first the king used hym
kyndly and gave us larg previlegese to trade in his domynions. And one
day a greate man envited hym to dyner, and sent his cheefe page to
conduct hym, he being sonne to a greate man. But he coming into the
place wheare Mr. Peacock sate, he gave hym [hard] wordes and bad hym
goe out and sit with the boyes. And, as som say, being in drink, he
tore the previlegese the king had geven hym for free trade and cast
the peeces under his feete. These and other matters (which is reported
he did) did much estrang the peoples hartes from hym, and, as it was
thought by som whome saw how matters went, was the cheefe occation
which caused his death.</p>

<p>Mr. Adames and Ed. Sayer were very ernest to have had speech with the
kyng, which at first that greate nobelman was contented, as it seemed.
But, when he knew they would bring in question the murthering of Mr.
Peacock (he being giltie of it), he put them affe from tyme to

gone, out of dowbt they had byn murthered in the way.</p>

<p>I am of your Wor. opinion that, except we procure trade into China, it
will not quite cost to mentayne a factory in Japon.... I have this
yeare byn againe at themperours court, in company of Mr. Wickham and
Mr. Wm. Adames, hoping to have got our previlegese enlarged, as
Codsquin Dono and Oyen Dono did put me in hope the last yeare.... We
gave the present to themperour as from his Matie., and amongst the
rest went a scritorio sent in adventure from my Lady Smith, esteemed
at 40 markes, with the gloves, mittens, looking glasse and other
silver implementes in it, with an other present aparte for the shipp,
as the Japon custom is. Which presentes were taken in good sort, with
many complementall wordes; but in the end were answered we had as larg
prevelegese as any other strangers, wherewith we might rest contented,
or, yf we fownd not trade to our content, we might departe when we
pleased and seeke better in an other place. So then I desird I might
have an answer to the letter he had receved from the Kinges Matie. of
England, wherby he might perceve I had delivered both letter and
present. But answer was made me, the letter was sent to his father,
Ogosho Samma, the deceased Emperor, and therefore held ominios amongst
the Japons to answer to dead mens letters. I aledged they needed not
to feare that we had any accoyntance with the pristes or padres; but
they tould me that was all one, the Emperour would have his owne
vassales to get the benefite to bring up merchandize rather then
strangers. So that now it has com to passe, which before I feared,
that a company of rich usurers have gotten this sentence against us,
and com downe together every yeare to Langasaque and this place, and
have allwais byn accustomed
<!--302.png--><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span>
to buy by the <i>pancado</i> (as they call
it), or whole sale, all the goodes which came in the carick from
Amacau, the Portingales having no prevelegese as we have, but only a
monson trade, and therefore must of necessety sell.</p>

<p>The Chinas of late tyme, within these 2 or 3 yeares, have begun a
trade into certen ilandes called by them Tacca Sanga, and is named in
our sea cardes Isla Fermosa, neare to the cost of China. The place the
shiping enters into is called Las Islas Piscadores, but non but small
shiping can enter, nether will they suffer any shiping or trade with
any people but Chinas. It is within 30 leagues (as they say) of the
meane of China, soe that they make 2 or 3 voyages in small shipping
each monson. Andrea Dittis and Capt. Whow, his brother, are the
greatest adventurers for that place. They sent 2 small junckes the
last yeare, and bought silke for the one halfe they pay ether at
Cochinchina or Bantam. The reason was the greate aboundance which came
together this yeare and the littell money that was sent to buy, so
that above one halfe was retorned into China for want of money, for
they say the people are barbarous and have not the use of silver.</p>

<p>I have rec. 2 letters from the Kynges Matie. to the King of China,

som stricter termes. Mr. Ball writes me that no Chinas at Bantam dare
nether translate them nor carry them when they are translated, upon
payne of their lives and even of all their generation. But these our
China frendes, Dittis and Whaw, will not only translate them, but send
them by such as will see them delivered. But their opinion is, yt is
not good to send the thretnyng letter, for they are assured there will
nothing be donne with the king by force. But as we have a good

<p>After my humble dutie remembred, may it please yow to understand that,
by the indirect dealinges and unlooked for proceadinges of the
Hollanders, this is the therd yeare since we hadd any shipping came
from England or Bantam to Japan. Neather in all this tyme have we had
any conveance to enforme your Worshipps of the manifold abuses
<!--306.png--><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 302]</span>
offered unto us within these kingdoms of Japon, notwithstanding the
lardge prevelegese we have from the Emperour that the Japons them
selves may not meddell with us. Yet these Hollanders have, by sound of
trumpet abord all their shipps in the harbour of Firando, procleamed
open warrs against our English nation, both by sea and land, with fire
and sworde, to take our shipps and goods and destroy our persons to
the uttermost of their power, as to their mortall enemies.</p>

<p>And their cheefe comander which came hither last, called Adam
Westerwood, sett my life at sale, offering 50 R. of 8 to any man that
could kill me, and 30 R. for each other Englishman they could kill;
which their proceadinges could not be soe secretly donne, but I hadd
dailie notis thereof by som of their owne people, although they were
comanded upon payne of death to the contrary. And because your Wors.
shall understand all how it hath passed, it is as hereafter followeth,
viz.:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>After that the comander (as they call hym), Jno. Derickson Lamb, came
hither from the Molucos and passed by the Manillias, where he took
divers China junckes and staid soe long on that cost that the Spanish
gallions came out against hym and sunck the admerall shipp, called the
<i class="shipname">New Sunne</i>, wherein Derickson Lamb hym selfe was, whoe escaped very
hardly abord an other shipp, wherein he came to Japon. The Spaniardes
also burned two other of the Hollandes fleete, and made all the rest
to run away, without losse of any Spanish shipp, etc.</p>

<p>And Jno. Derickson Lamb, going away, left the <i class="shipname">Ould Sunne</i>, a great
ship with 38 or 40 peeces ordinance in her, with an other shipp,
called the <i class="shipname">Gallias</i>, of 300 tonns, as they say, with 30 peeces of
ordinance in her, and sent them abootehawling one the cost of China,
and from thence to the Manillias, where they h[ad] the rifling of xvi
seale of China junckes, and filled them with such as
<!--307.png--><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 303]</span>
they liked and
sett the rest on fire, and brought the China junckes along with them,
being the best and ruchliest laden, puting som 8 or 9 Hollanders into
each junck; but, by fowle wether at sea, they lost company of the
shipps, soe that the Chinas, being too strong for the Hollanders, cut
all their throtes, and carid all the junckes into China, as we hadd
certen newes thereof.</p>

<p>These 2 shipps, the <i class="shipname">Sunne</i> and <i class="shipname">Gallias</i>, arived at Firando the 6th
and 8th day of June, 1618. And the 8th day of August after heare
arived an English shipp, called the <i class="shipname">Attendance</i>, which the Hollanders
sent hither from the Molucas, to our greater disgrace, but not an
Englishman in her. So that, by generall consent, it was thought fitt I
went to themperours court to complaine, thinking we might have hadd
restetution, considering the lardge preveleges we have in Japon. But
answer was made that for factes comitted in other places themperor
would not meddell with it, but for anything donne in his owne
dominions he would see us have right.</p>

<p>Soe the three forenamed shipps, <i class="shipname">Sunne</i>, <i class="shipname">Gallias</i>, and <i class="shipname">Attendance</i>,
were sett out againe, the <i class="shipname">Sunne</i> to carry their most best stuffes and
silke, her full lading, to goe for Bantam; and the other two to goe
for the Manillas, to meete an other Hollandes fleete, because they had
certen news that 6 of the King of Spaines gallions were cast away per
misfortune at Manillas, which was true, soe that the Spaniardes hadd
no strength to com out against them. Soe they took 3 China junckes
more, but noe greate wealth in them, only they found such good
refreshing that it saved the lives of their hongerstarved men;
otherwaies they hadd never lived to see Japon.</p>

<p>Soe now may it please your Wors. to understand this last yeare, I
meane reckning before Christmas, here cam 7 seale of Hollanders for
this cuntrey of Japon and to this towne of Firando, viz.:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><!--308.png--><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 304]</span>
1. The <i class="shipname">Bantam</i>, a shipp of 1000 tonns, wherin Adam Westerwood
came.</p>

<p>2. The <i class="shipname">"New Moone</i>, a shipp of 7 or 800 tonns, vizadmerall.</p>

<p>3. The <i class="shipname">Gallias</i> before named, of above 300 tonns.</p>

<p>4. The <i class="shipname">Attendance</i>, thenglish shipp before named.</p>

<p>5. The <i class="shipname">Swan</i>, an other English shipp taken by them at Molucas.</p>

<p>And out of these shipps 3 Englishmen escaped ashore and came to
thenglish howse to seeke releefe, telling us they were used more like
dogges then men amongst the Hollanders. Their names are as followeth:
John Moore, John Joones, Edward Curwin; these 3 men brought presoners
in Hollandes shipps. The Hollanders demanded these 3 men to be
retorned back unto them; unto whome I made answer, I would first see
their comition how they durst presume to take our English shiping,
men, and goodes, as they did. So then they went to the <i class="title">Tono</i> (or
King) of Firando, and demanded that their English <i>kengos</i> (which in
Japons is sclaves) should be sent back unto them. Unto whome the
<i class="title">tono</i> made answer that he took not the English to be sclaves to the
Hollanders, we having such lardge preveleges in Japon as we hadd, and
therefore willed them to goe to themperour and demand them of hym, and
what he ordayned should be performed, etc.</p>

<p>Also their came a penisse from the Molucas, called the <i>Fox</i>, to bring
newes of the fight betwixt thenglish fleete and the Hollanders att
Jaccatra, and that these shipps should make hast to the Molucas with
powder, shott, victuelles, and other provition, etc.</p>

<p>And last of all came an other greate shipp from Pattania, called the
<i class="shipname">Angell</i>, being the admerall of 3 shipps which came together and sent
of purpose to take the <i class="shipname">Samson</i> and <i class="shipname">Hownd</i>, two other English shipps,
wherin Capt. Jno. Jourden, the presedent, came cheefe comander; they
<!--309.png--><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span>
Hollanders coming upon them on a sudden as they road at an ancor in
the roade of Pattania, nott dowbting any such matter, where they took
both the said shipps, after the death of Capt. Jourden and others. Out
of which shipp <i class="shipname">Angell</i> Mr. Wm. Gourden and Michell Payne escaped
ashore, by the assistance of Mr. Wm. Adames; otherwais they hadd byn
sent captives (as the Duch terme it) to the Molucas. Mr. Gourden was
master of the <i class="shipname">Hownd</i>, and Michell Payne carpenter of the <i class="shipname">Samson</i>. As
also a Welchman, named Hugh Williams, escaped from them and came to
the English howse the morrow after. By which 3 men, as also by an open
letter which I receved from Mr. Adam Denton from Pattania in the Duch
shipp <i class="shipname">Angell</i>, we understand of the proceadinges of the Hollanders
against our nation; the copie of which letter I send your Wors. here
inclozed.</p>

<p>But to conclud the unruly dealinges of the Hollanders: when they saw
they could not by any meanes gett back the Englishmen which escaped
from them, allthough they laid secrett ambushes ashore to have taken
them, which being reveled to me by som of their owne people, then they
came to outbrave us in the streetes before our owne dores, urging us
with vild speeches; soe that from words som of our people and they
fell to blowes, where one of the Hollanders got a scram, which made
the rest soe madd that they came on shore by multetudes, thinking by
force to have entred into our howse and cutt all our throates, geveing
3 assaltes in one day. Yet the Japons took our partes, that they could
doe us no harme, although there were v. or vj. C. of them against v.
or vj. persons of us. And the next day morning after, when we thought
nothing, a company of them entred our howse, armed with piks, swordes,
and <i>cattans</i>, where they wounded John Coaker and an other, thinking
they hadd kild one of them at least, as they made their bragges after.
Soe that we weare constrayned to keepe in our howse a gard of Japons,
night and day, armed, at
<!--310.png--><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 306]</span>
meate, drink, and wages, to your Wors. greate
charge. Soe that the king of Firando comanded watch and ward to be
kept in the streetes, that noe Hollanders might be suffered to passe
by our dores. But then they went in swarmes by water, shaking their
naked swords at us, calling us by a thousand filthie names; which
coming to the knowledg of the <i class="title">tono</i>, he sent for Capt. Jacob Speck,
princepall (or cape merchant) of the Hollanders in Japon, and caused
hym to geve a writing in Japons before witnesses, with his ferme at
it, that from that tyme forward no Hollander should misuse an
Englishman, nether in word nor deed, and then caused me, Richard
Cocks, to geve an other to the same effect, with my ferme at it,
before the same witnesses, that noe Englishman should doe the like to
any Hollanders. Yet, before 3 or 4 daies were passed, the Hollanders
began againe to misuse us; for that Edmond Sayer, being retorned of a
voyage he hadd made for your Wors. affares to Cochinchina and arived
at Nangasaque, sentt Richard King to Firando to advertis me thereof
and to bring our <i>foyfone</i> (or bark) with hym to carry the comodetis
he hadd brought to Firando. But as the said Ric. King was going out in
the said bark, accompanied with our <i>jurebasso</i>, the Hollanders armed
out five or six barkes or shipp boates after them, full of men, with
guns, pikes, swordes, and other weapons, and took hym presoner with
the bark and carid hym to the Hollands howse, using hym very
churlishly. The <i class="title">tono</i> being an eye witnesse and looker on when they
did it, mooved hym soe much that he sent out certen boates full of
souldiers after them, to have reskewed Ric. King; but they came to
late, for the Hollanders hadd carried hym into their howse before they
came. Soe the souldiers laid hand on Capt. Speck hym selfe and carid
hym presoner to the <i class="title">tonos</i> howse, where he remeaned most parte of the
day, till Richard King was sett free.</p>

<p><!--311.png--><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 307]</span>
But this matter was noe sowner overpast but our junck arived from
Syam, wherin Mr. Eaton came and advized me of their arivall on this
coast, and to send them a boate or two to helpe to toe them in, which
I did; and Ed. Sayer, Richard Kinge, and John Coaker went in them with
our <i>jurebasso</i>. But, passing by the Hollandes shipps in this harbor,
they bent a peece of ordinance against them, which took falce fire.
Which they seeing, discharged 4 or 5 muskettes at them with langarell
(or cheane) shott; but, by greate fortune, missed the Englishmen and
kild a Japon. Which open injuries being offered against us in Japon
(contrary to the preveleges geven us by the Emperour), yt was thought
fitt (and agreed upon by a generall councell) that I should goe to the
court of the Emperour of Japon, to make their doinges knowne unto his
Matie. and to demand justice; which I did, with much labour and greate
cost to your Wors. And order was geven by the Emperours comand and his
previe councell to the <i class="title">Tono</i> or King of Firando to heare both parties
and see justis performed. Yet, from that tyme till now, there is
nothing donne, although I have divers tymes very instantly desired it
of the kinge, whose best answer I eaver could gett was, that the
Hollanders had kild no Englishman, but a Japonar, his owne vassale,
which yf he were content to pardon, what hadd I to doe therwith?</p>

<p>And that which is worse, we being makinge cables for our junck in the
streetes of Firando, the servantes of a gentelman called Semi Dono
picked a quarrell against Ed. Sayer as he, Wm. Eaton, and Jno.
Osterwick were looking on the workmen; and, without any reazon came
out against them with clubbs and staves, and knockt downe Ed. Sayer,
wounding hym very sore; and the rest escaped not free, but were
shrodly beaten, and, hadd they not by good fortune gotten into a
howse, they hadd kild them all. For the which abuse I went first to
Semi Dono to
<!--312.png--><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 308]</span>
complaine, but he would not vouchsaffe to speake to
me. Soe I complained to the kinge, thinking to have hadd justice; but,
to the contrary, he sent me word that by councell he hadd banished two
men of Semi Donos out of his dominions, which were the authors
thereof, as he did the like by Edmond Sayer, telling me that, yf I did
not forthwith send hym to Nangasaque, he would geve orders to kill hym
the first tyme he went out of the dores into the street. Unto which I
made answer, it was against the preveleges geven us by the Emperour,
desiring hym to lett me pleade for my selfe, to show my greefes, or
else lett the matter be brought before the Emperour. But the kinge
would not heare me speak any ferther in this matter, but badd me stand
to the danger, yf I sent hym not away. Yet still I pleaded that the
Hollanders hadd donne much more, even to the killinge of Japons, and
yet were not banished nor any thing said to them for it, nether for
any other abuses offered against us; and Ed. Sayer nor no other
Englishman hadd nether wounded nor hurt any Japon for this matter he
was banished for, yet he hym selfe being wounded almost to death. But
all would not serve, soe that I was constrayned to send Ed. Sayer to
Nangasaque, and soe from thence to goe for Bantam or any other place
where the English fleete is, to geve the precedent and cheefe
comanders to understand thereof, etc.</p>

<p>For may it please your Wors. to understand that, having soe many
Englishmen lying idly in the factory, with those which were heare
before, and noe shipping to carry them away, as well to avoid charg of
howse keepinge as also to geve your Wors. to understand how matters
passe, it was ordayned per a general councell to buy a small <i>soma</i> or
vessell of som 50 tonns, to carry these men whose names follow (at
their owne ernest request) to seek out the fleete in Java, Sumatra, or
else wheare, to helpe to fight against the commune enemie, as they
have procleamed
<!--313.png--><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 309]</span>
them selves, I meane the Hollander, as also to
carry gunpowder, shott, beefe, pork, biskitt, tunnie fish, and other
provition, soe much as conveniently the vessell can carry. The names
of the Englishmen which goe are as followeth, viz:&mdash;Edmond Sayer,
James Burges, Thomas Harod, Wm. Gorden, Robt. Hawley, Jno. Portes,
Migell Payne, John Coaker, John Moore, John Joones, Ed. Curwine, Jno.
Yonge, Hugh Williams, Peeter Griffine. Also there goe 9 Japon
marrenars with them for their more strengthning, as also because their
seals are of mattes, after the Japon fation, wherin they are more
expert then our English men. And, for their better defence they carry
4 falcons, 2 of brasse and 2 of iron, with 2 long brasse bases, 2
fowlars or murtherers, 3 hargabush of crock, 5 English muskettes, and
8 Japon calivers, with good powder and shott suffitient, etc. The
junck name is called the <i class="shipname">Godspeed</i>, of the burthen of 50 tonns or
upwardes, and cost us iiij C. xxx <i class="measure">tais</i> first peny, being open behind
as all <i>somas</i> are, but we have made her now to steare shipp fation.
God prosper her and send them a good voyage.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Truly to my hartes greefe I am eavery day more then other out of hope
of any good to be donne in Japon, except trade may be procured into
China, which I am not yet out of hope of. Although Capt. Whaw of
Nangasaque be dead, whoe was a cheefe dealer hearin, yet his brother,
Capt. Andrea Dittis of Firando, tells me it is concluded upon, and
that he expects a kinsman of his to com out of China with the
Emperours passe, promesing to goe hym selfe with me in person, when we
have any shipping com to goe in; for in Japon shipping we cannot goe
for China. This Andrea Dittis is now chosen capten and cheefe comander
of all the Chinas in Japon, both at Nangasaque, Firando, and else
wheare, and I trust in God will prove the author in soe happie a
matter as to gett trade into China.</p>

<p><!--314.png--><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</span>
But of all the merchandiz we have this last yeare, before Christmas
came, from Syam, Cochinchina, and Tonkyn, as reed wood, lead, deare
skins, and silke of severall prices, we cannot make sale of any thing;
which maketh me to wonder, for the other yeare before was much greater
quantety of all comodetis and yet sould dearer.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Our lead, which never heretofore lesse then 6 <i class="measure">tais</i>, now worth 5
<i class="measure">tais</i>; but none dare buy it for feare of themperour. Soe I have set
it at 5&#189; <i class="measure">tais pico</i>. But themperours <i>bongew</i> will not take it
absolutely at that price, before he have made it knowne to themperours
councell, he being now bond up to the court and called thither per
themperour, as it is thought to put an other in his place, which God
forbid; he being now ruch is better to be dealt withall, but, yf a new
hongry fello com, he will gnawe to the very boanes, as others
heretofore have fownd by experience, two or three haveing byn changed
in my time. But that which cheefly spoileth the Japon trade is a
company of ruch usurers whoe have gotten all the trade of Japon into
their owne handes; soe that heretofore by theare meanes we lost our
preveleges geven us per Ogosho Samma themperour, wherin he permitted
us to trade into all partes of Japon not excepted, and now per this
Emperour Shongo Samma we are pend up in Firando and Nangasaque only,
all other places forbidden us. For they have soe charmed themperour
and his councell, that it is in vayne to seeke for remedy. And these
fellowes are nott content to have all at their owne disposing above,
but they com downe to Firando and Nangasaque, where they joyne
together in seting out of junckes for Syam, Cochinchina, Tonkin,
Camboja, or any other place where they understand that good is to be
donne, and soe furnish Japon with all sortes of comodeties which any
other stranger can bring, and then stand upon their puntos, offering
others what they
<!--315.png--><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 311]</span>
list them selves, knowing no man will buy it but
them selves or such as they please to joyne in company with them,
nether that any stranger can be suffered to transport it into any
other parte of Japon. Which maketh me alltogether aweary of Japon.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>And for our English broad cloth, I canot find that any greate quantety
will be vented in Japon. For they use it not in garmentes, except som
fewe in an outward cloak or garment now of late. But the greatest use
they put it to is for cases or coveringes for armours, pikes,
<i>langenattes</i>, <i>cattans</i>, or sables, with muskettes or guns. And the
best cullars are stametes or blackes, with reddes, for venting any
quantetie. And the best tyme is against warrs, for then every noble
man will have his armours and munition sett out in gallant sort. But
clothes of above xxli. str. a whole clo. are too deare for Japon, for
they doe not respect soe much the fynenesse of the cloth as they do
the quantetie of the measure. And the cullers which are best after
black and redd are sadd blewes, culler du roy, or mingled cullers
neare unto that of culler due roy.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>So that, to conclude this tediouse and unprofitable discourse, I
esteem our Japon trade alltogether unprofetable, yf wee procure not
trade into China. But, yf it please God that your Wors. lay hould or
determen to sett foote in the Molucas, then Japon must be your store
howse, as it is the Hollanders. For from hence they make their
provition in aboundance, viz. great ordinance both of brasse and iron,
with powder and shott good cheape; beefe and pork, in greate
quantetie; meale and bisquite, as much as they will; garvances, or
small peaze or beanes, in abondance; and dried fish lyke a breame,
called heare <i>tay</i>, in aboundance; tunnie fish salted, in greate
quantetie; rack or aquavite, of any sort, in aboundance; rice, in what
quantetie
<!--316.png--><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 312]</span>
they will; with other sortes of Japon wine made of rise,
what they will; and pilchardes, in greate quantetie, either pickled or
otherwais. And for provition of shiping, either tymber or plankes,
with mastes, yardes, or what else to make a shipp, with good
carpenters to work it, as also rozen or pitch enough, but no tarr.
Also ther is hempe indifferent to make cables, and them which can
resonably well work it. And for iron work, neales, and such lyke,
there is noe want, and smiths that can make ancors of hamer work of 20
or 30 C. wight, yf need be; for such have byn made for carickes which
came from Amacon to Nangasaque, etc.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Also heretofore at severall tymes I have sent my acco. to Bantam,
according to your Wor. order, with coppies thereof, to the precedent
or cheefe in that place, the other to be sent for England. Yet, as I
understand, they have detayned all at Bantam and sent non for England;
and Mr. Balle per name hath wrott to some Englishmen in this place,
whoe loved me not soe littell but they shewed me his letters, wherin
he taxed my acco. to be erronios and alltogether falce and fetched
about with a trick beyond rule, soe that he wondered they should jumpe
soe neare in ballance, being soe notably falce. But yf Mr. Balle hadd
byn soe good a frend unto me as he would make me to beleeve in som
lynes of his letters (yet he never gave me roast meate but he did
beate me with the spitt)&mdash;I beeseeke your Wors. to pardon me yf I be
too forward of tonge herein&mdash;I say, yf Mr. Balle had ought me soe much
good will, yt hadd byn a frendly parte to have amended that which hadd
byn amiss, yf such were to be donne, and then to have sent the acco.
forward, and not to keepe all back, saying it was falce or
erronios.... My greefe is, I lie in a place of much losse and expence
to your Wors. and no benefitt to my selfe, but losse of tyme in my
ould adge,
<!--317.png--><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 313]</span>
allthough God knoweth my care and paines is as much as yf
benefite did come thereby. Yet truly, yf the tyme or place, or other
occation amend it not, I shall, as I came a pore man out of England,
retorne a beggar home, yf your Wor. have noe consideration thereof,
although your Wor. shall never find that I have byn a gamstar or
riatouse person which have spent eather your Wor. or my owne goodes
riatosly or out of order. I beseek your Wors. to pardon my overbould
speeches hearin. But, yf it hadd pleased God that Generall Keeling or
any other your Wors. apointed hadd com to Japon to have overseene the
affares in this factory, it would have byn a greate comfort unto me
and ridd me of a greate deale of care; for most an end for the space
of two yeares Mr. Nealson hath byn very sick, and Mr. Jno. Osterwick
littell lesse, and both of them at this instant soe extreame sick that
I dowbt much of their recovery, which hath [byn] and is a hinderance
to me in the proceadinges of acco. and writing out of coppies, they
two being all the helpe I have hadd, others going abroad on voyages
for your Wor. affares. God of his mercy send them their healthes, for
they are soe weake that I esteeme they cannot write by this conveance
nether to your Wors. nor noe other frendes.</p>

<p>And, whereas heretofore I wrott your Wors. that Shongo Samma, the
Emperour that now is, had shortned our preveleges, that we should
trade into noe other partes of Japon but only Nangasaque and Firando,
and our shipping to goe only to Firando, now he hath permitted us to
goe with our shipps for Nangasaque as well as Firando at our chose.
And the harbor at Nangasaque is the best in all Japon, wheare there
may 1,000 seale of shipps ride land lockt, and the greatest shipps or
carickes in the world may goe in and out at pleasure and ride before
the towne within a cables length of the shore in 7 or 8 fathom water
at least, yt being a greate cittie and many ruch marchantes
<!--318.png--><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span>
dwelling
in it, where, to the contrary, Firando is a fisher towne and a very
small and badd harbor, wherin not above 8 or 10 shipps can ride at a
tyme without greate danger to spoile one other in stormy weather; and
that which is worst, noe shipping can enter in or out of that harbour,
but they must have both tide and winde as also 8 or 10 penisses or
barkes to toe them in and out, the currant runeth soe swift that
otherwaies they canot escape runing ashore; where, to the contrary,
there is no such mattar at Nangasaque, yt being one of the fairest and
lardgest harbours that eaver I saw, wherinto a man may enter in and
goe out with shiping at all tymes, the wind serving, without helpe of
boate or penisse. And in Nangasaque there is noe king nor noble man,
but only the Emperours <i>bongew</i> (or governar) of the place; soe that
we need not to geve presentes to more then one at any shipps entring.
But at Firando there is the king hym selfe, with two of his brothers,
and 3 or 4 of his uncles, besides many other noble men of his kindred;
all which look for presentes, or else it is no living amongst them;
and that which is more, they are allwaies borowing and buying, but
sildom or neaver make payment, except it be the king hym selfe. So
that it maketh me altogether aweary to live amongst them, we not being
abell to geve and lend them as the Hollanders doe, whoe geve them
other mens goods which they neaver paid for. Soe that they are
accompted better then true men and better used then we, as apeareth by
banishing Ed. Sayer without any occation, which it may be the <i class="title">Tono</i>
of Firando may repent before it be long, and, as som say, wisheth
allready it were undon; for I have written to Syam, Pattania, and
Bantam, that yf they send any shipping for Japon hearafter, that my
opinion is, and the rest of the Englishmen heare are the lyke, to send
them for Nangasaque, where the governor offereth to lett us have a
plott of ground or to take a house in any place of the cittie where we
lyke best. So that now
<!--319.png--><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span>
many tyme and often we have wished that your
Wor. howsing att Firando stood at Nangasaque, which heretofore was not
thought fitt, because then a papist Portingale bushopp lived in the
towne and ther was 10 or 12 parish churches, besids monestaries, all
which are now pulld downe to the grownd this yeare, an end being made
thereof; and the places where all such churches and monestaries weare,
with the churchyords, are all turned into streetes, and all the dead
mens boanes taken out of the grownd and cast forth for their frendes
and parentes to bury them where they please. I doe not rejoyce herin,
but wish all Japon were Christians; yet in the tyme of that bushopp
heare were soe many prists and Jesuists with their partakers, that one
could not passe the streetes without being by them called Lutranos and
herejos, which now we are very quiet and non of them dare open his
mouth to speake such a word.</p>

<p>May it please yow to understand that, since my arivall in Japon in
these eastarne partes of the world, I wrot yow an other letter by a
Dutch chirurgion, called Mr. Abraham
<!--320.png--><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</span>
Blancard, advising your Wors.
of my long voyadge into these partes, passing by Cape Bona Speranza,
the Redd Sea, Bantam in Java major, the Molucas, and soe to the
eastwardes of the Phillipinas into these kingdoms of Japon, wheare now
I have remeaned allmost the space of vij yeares. Of the which I
thought good to adviz your Wors. of the just occation of my abcense,
to the entent I fall into noe broake for the neclecting thereof, as I
know others have donne. I also wrot your Wors. from Bayon in France to
same effect, many yeares past, by a Duchman of Middebrogh, called
James Vrolick. Which former letters I make no dowbt came unto your
Wors. handes, etc.</p>

<p>Allso, may it please yow to understand that we are much molested in
these partes of the world with the unruly Hollanders, whoe have
procleamed open warrs against our English nation both by sea and land,
and to take our shipps and goods and kill our persons as their mortall
enemies, wheresoever they find us. And, for better proof thereof, they
broght two English shipps this yeare into Japon, out of which 3
Englishmen escaped and came to our English howse for releefe. The
shipps names taken weare, viz. the <i class="shipname">Swan</i> and the <i class="shipname">Attendance</i>.</p>

<p>They took also two other English shipps this yeare, riding at an ancor
in the roade of Pattania, not dowbting any such matter, three
Hollandes shipps coming upon them on the sudden. In which hurly burly
Capt. John Jourden, our precedent of the Indies, lost his life, with
many others. One of which 3 shipps (which took them) came this yeare
to Firando in Japon, out of whome escaped other 3 Englishmen and came
to the English howse for releefe, as the former did; by whome we
understood the shipps taken weare the <i class="shipname">Samson</i> and the <i class="shipname">Hownde</i>; the
Hollanders at Firando takeing their escape in such dudgin that they
demanded their captives (as it pleased them to call them) to be
deliverd back againe unto them. Unto whome I answered that I would
<!--321.png--><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</span>
first see their comition, how they durst presume to take our shipping,
goods, and persons, as they did. Unto which they replied nothing, but
went to the <i class="title">Tono</i> (or King) of Firando, demanding of hym that their
English slaves (as they termed them) might be retorned back unto them.
Unto whome he answerd he took not Englishmen to be slaves to them,
but, yf they pretended any such matter, they might goe to the
Emperour, and what he ordayned should be performed. Soe they, seeing
their expectations frustrated, ment to have entred our English howse
and cut all our throates; which they wanted but littell to have
effected, geving 3 assalts against us in one day, they being 100 of
them to 1 Englishman; yet God preserved us from them, the Japoneses,
our neighbours, taking our partes. Soe that then their generall or
cheefe comander, called Adam Westarwood, sett my life at sale,
promesing 50 rialles of 8 to any one would kill me, and 30 of the like
for the life of each other English merchant, with many other
stratagems they used against us too long to be repeated. Yet God
hitherto hath defended us from them all. Of the which I thought good
to advertis your Wors., knowing well that many of yow are of this
Right Honble. and Right Worll. Sosietie or Companie which trade into
the East Indies, of which I my selfe am a pore and unworthie member,
as I am the like of the Merchantes Adventurars and made free of the
ould Hance.</p>

<p>And soe, with my humble dutie remembred, with desire and my prayer
unto Allmightie God to blesse and prosper your Wors. in all your

themperour only; and his councell sett the price from tyme to tyme as
they please. Soe this yeare, per generall consent, there weare 4 men
sent up to themperours cort with presentes. They departed from hence
the last of August, and as yet are not retorned:</p>

<p class="indent">for thenglish,</p>

<p class="p0 indent">for the Hollanders,</p>

<p class="p0 indent4">Matias van der Brook</p>

<p>whome, as we understand per their letters, are frendly entertayned
both of themperour and his councell, but stay longer for a dispach
then they thought of, by reason of the taking of a friggat which came
from Manillias, wherin weare both Portingals, Spaniardes, and Japons,
and amongst the rest ij semenary pristes (or Jesuists), people
defended not to com into Japon, which maketh the better for us. Yet we
know not whether themperour will let us have it for good prize or noe,
till our men retorne from Edo, of the which I will certefie your Wor.
per my next.</p>

<p>I did make full accompt to have retorned for England this yeare, but
that Mr. Thomas Brockedon and Mr. Augusten Spalding, presedentes at
Bantam, wrot me the want of merchantes in the factory as also to send
along in these shipps, willing me to furnish their want out of this
factory, which, God willing, I will, and wish I might have byn one of
them my selfe. But I hope the next yeare som new supplies may be sent
for this factory, to thentent I may now retorne for my cuntrey, I
having now served your Wors. a prentishipp of ten yeares since I
departed out of England; and I know there hath not wanted som to geve

Wm. Nealson
departed out of this life in Marche last, being wasted away with a
consumption, and before divers witnesses gave me all he had both in
these partes and else wheare, as I have it under their handes to shew;
and yf God had called me to His mercy before Mr. Nealson, then had he
had as much of myne.</p>

<p>And our good frend Capt. Wm. Adames, whoe was soe longe before us in
Japon, departed out of this world the xvjth of May last, and made Mr.
Wm. Eaton and my selfe his overseers, geveing the one halfe of his
estate to his wife and childe in England and the other halfe to a
sonne and a doughter he hath in Japon. The coppie of his will with an
other of his inventory (or acco. of his estate) I send to his wife and
doughter per Capt. Marten Pring, their good frend well knowne to them
long tyme past. And I have delivered one hundred poundes starling to
divers of the <i class="shipname">James Royalls</i> company, enterd into the purcers book,
to pay two for one in England, is two hundred poundes strling, to Mrs.
Adames and her doughter. For yt was not his mind his wife should have
all, in regard she might marry an other husband and carry all from his
childe, but rather that it should be equally parted betwixt them. Of
the which I thought good to adviz your Wors. And the rest of his
debtes and estate being gotten in, I will ether bring or send it per
first occation offerd and that may be most for their profett,
according as the deceased put his trust in me and his other frend, Mr.
Eaton.</p>

<p>I know not what else to write your Wors., only, as yet, there is noe
order com out of China to let us have trade, for that the Hollanders
men of warr have shut up their trade that few dare look out. And,
besids, the Cheenas them selves robb on an other at sea, thinking to
lay all the falt on the Dutch and English; but som have byn
intersepted in som provinces of Japon and paid dearly for it. And

<p>I canot but be sorofull for the losse of such a man as Capt. Wm.
Adames was, he having byn in such favour with two Emperours of Japon
as never was any Christian in these partes of the worlde, and might
freely have entred and had speech with themperours, when many Japon
kinges stood without and could not be permitted. And this Emperour
hath conformed the lordshipp to his sonne which thother Emperour gave
to the father.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Yt is strang to see the changes of merchandizing soe altered since our
first arivall in Japon; for heretofore yearly white raw silk was sould
at 500, 400, and 300 <i class="measure">taies</i> the <i class="measure">pico.</i> at least, and now it is
fallne to 130, yea som have sould for 105 <i class="measure">taies</i> the <i class="measure">pico.</i> this
yeare, which 3 yeares past was worth 300 <i class="measure">tais pico.</i> The reason is, a
company of ruch men have got all the trade of Japon into their handes.
Soe they
<!--327.png--><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 323]</span>
agree all together and will not buy but at what price they
think good them selves; and is not to be remedied.</p>

<p>And it is geven out that themperour will defend that noe more lead
shall com into Japon till this greate quantety brought by us and the
Hollanders be spent. For the Hollanders brought in their shipping this
yeare 4000 <i class="measure">pico</i>. Eng. lead and 1000 <i class="measure">pico</i>. from Syam in their
junck. Soe that the Hollanders have 5000 <i class="measure">pico</i>. lead com this yeare;
but a great part of it is small barrs, such as is com in our shiping
this yeare, and I think taken out of our English shipping which they
took heretofore.</p>

<p>Broad cloth, kersies, and perpetuanos I think will prove the best
comodetie for Japon, and redds and stamettes and blacks best cullers,
and, yf they sell not at an instant, yet tyme will vent all. Som other
mingled cullers, as cullor du roy or such lyke, will not doe amis; but

Portingals partes against us, with all the merchantes of that place,
Miaco, and Edo, geving the Emperour to understand that both we and the
Hollanders are pirates and theevs and live upon nothing but the spoile
of the Chinas and others, which is the utter overthrow of the trade in
Japon, noe one daring to com hither for feare of us. By which reportes
themperour and his councell are much moved against us, as the King of
Firando doth tell us, whoe is newly retorned from the Emperours court,
where he hath married the Emperours kinswoaman, which hath brought hym
into greate creddit, and he is the only stay now which we have in
Japon. And by his order the Hollandes capt., Leonard Camps, and my

carry out noe Japons to man our shiping, nether make nor carry out any
ordinance, gunpowder, shott, guns, pikes, <i>langanattes</i>, <i>cattans</i>,

out nether rise, bred, nor wine, nor flesh; but that is not yet donne.
But the other is procleamed, and waiters apointed to look out night

that, yf we get noe redresse for these matters, it is noe abiding for
us in Japon, and better to know it at first then last what we may

Manillas the Hollanders did much abuse our English men, and Wm.
Johnson vizadmerall was cheefe occation therof. Soe that they had like
to have gon together by the eares in the Manillias, to the totall
distraction of both fleetes, the enemie being so neare, yet by the
discretion of som it was pacefied; as I make acco. Capt. Adames hath
advized your Wors. at large, he being now apointed vizadmerall, much
against his will, by the Councell of Defence at Jaccatra, he dowbting
that yf the last yeare, when he was admerall, they feared not to doe
soe, that, now themselves are admerall, they will doe worse. And
herinclozed I send your Wors. a copie of a letter which I receved from
Molucas in a shipp of the Hollanders, sent from Mr. Wm. Nicolles,
agent, wherin your Wors. may see the proceadinges of the Hollanders in
those partes, as I make acco. he hath advized therof hym selfe. Truly
their proceadinges every wheare are allmost intolerable, and they are
generally hated thorowout all the Indies, and we much the worse
thought of now we are joyned with them.</p>

<p>Yt is very certen that with little danger our fleet of
<!--331.png--><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 327]</span>
defence may
take and sack Amacon in China, which is inhabeted by Portingales. For
the towne is not fortefied with walls; nether will the King of China
suffer them to doe it, nor to make any fortifecations, nor mount noe
ordinance upon any plotforme; and &#190; partes of the inhabetantes
are Chinas. And we are credably enformed that, these 2 last yeares,
when they did see but 2 or 3 of our shipp within sight of the place,
they weare all ready to run out of the towne, as I have advized the
Precedent and Councell of Defence at Jaccatra; and, had but 2 small
shipps, as the <i class="shipname">Bull</i> and <i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i>, entred this yeare, they might
easely have burnt and taken 17 seale of galliotas which weare at an
ancor, amongst which weare the 6 galliotas which came into Japon,
being then full laden; and, had they taken this fleet, the Portingales
hadd byn utterly undon, as they them selves confesse, and, that towne
being taken, all the Portingalles trade in these partes of the world
is quite spoiled, both for Manillias, Malacca, Goa, and else wheare.
And the King of China would gladly be ridd of their neighbourhood, as
our frendes which procure our entry for trade into China tell me, and
doe say that he wished that we could drive them from thence. But this
yeare there is 3 kings of China dead, the father and his two sonns,
the wives of the two bretheren procuring the poisoning of them both.
Soe that now a yong man of 14 or 15 yeares ould is com to be king,
being the sonne of one of the deceased brothers; which is a stay unto
our proceadinges to get trade into China, for that new petision must
be made, and our joyning with the Hollanders to take China juncks is
ill thought of. But the barbarousnesse of the Hollanders at Manillias
the last yeare is much; for, after they had taken the China junkes and
that the pore men had rendred them selves, the Hollandars did cut many
of them in peeces and cast many others into the sea; wherof our men
saved and took many of them up into our shipps;
<!--332.png--><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 328]</span>
and much more
distrucktion had byn made of them, had not Capt. Adames, the admerall,
prevented it.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the previleges which we and the Hollanders have from
themperours of Japon, that the Japons shall not execute any justice
upon our people, yet this yeare the justis of this place (but it was
in the abcense of the king) did cut offe the heades of ij Hollanders
which, being drunke, did brable with the Japons and drue out their
knives, as their custam is, and gave a skram or 2 to som Japons, one
being a souldier, yet kild noe man; and yet the Hollanders were haled
out into the filds and their heads cut offe and sent home to the
Hollands howse, which they refuced to receve, desiring them to leave
them with the bodies, which they did, and soe left them in the filds
to be eaten by crowes and dogges; which they had byn, had not som
Englishmen buried them.</p>

<p>And as som of our men goe along the streetes, the Japons kindly call
them in and geve them wine and whores till they be drunk, and then
stripp them of all they have (som of them stark naked) and soe turne
them out of dores. And som they keepe presoners, forging debtes upon
them, which som of our men sweare they owe not; yet it is noe
beleeving of all, for som of our men are bad enough; yet out of dowbt
the abuse is greate and never seene till the last yeare and this. For
the king hath (by our procurement) from the first made an edect that
the Japons should not trust our men without paying money for what they
tooke; for it is an ordenary course for som of our men to leave the
shipps and lie ashore in secret a wick, a fortnight, yea a month som
of them, and in the end cause their hostes to keepe them presoners,
telling us it is by force, yet confesse the debt som of 5, others of
10, 20, and 30 <i class="measure">taies</i> per man which they owe, desiring it may be paid
and put upon their wages. Which course of theirs I withstand in all I
<!--333.png--><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 329]</span>
may, and make many set free without payment, which they murmur at as a
disgrance and discredett to them, swearing, woundes and blood, your
Wors. are indebted to them in farr greater somms and yet they cannot
be masters of their owne; soe that the trowble I have with them heare
is much. Nether can ther comanders curb them, they rise in such greate
multetudes, as for example I advised your Wors. the last yeare, and
laid violent handes on the admerall, Capt. Adames; and this yeare the
<i class="shipname">Bulls</i> company and most parte of the <i class="shipname">Moones</i> mutened, and
all the rest promised them to doe the like, but were prevented, for
that som of these weare taken and punished, which caused the others to
feare.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>And for the shipp called the English <i class="shipname">Hope</i> (for the Hollanders
have one of the same name) is ether cast away or else the company have
revolted and run away with the shipp and kild the master or else carid
hym away with them perforce, for every on thinketh that the master,
Mr. Carnaby, would never consent thereunto; but they suspect one
Thorneton and the chirurgion, with other mutenose persons in her, for
that this Thornton hath a brother which they say is a piratt and
entertayned per the Duke of Florence. Soe they imagin, after they have
made what purchase they may, that they will direct their course
thither with the shipp. This is the opinion of the cheefe in our

<p>As yet Gonrok Dono is not come to Firando, and God knoweth when he
will; for, as it is said, he stayeth at Nangasaque to put to death
many Japon Christians for haboring of papist pristes secretly, and
till he com the King of this place will not suffer us to goe to the
Emperour with our presentes, which maketh us stand in dowbt whether he
secretly take part with Gonrok Dono and the papistes our enemies

Portingales have preveled against us at Emperours court. For the
kinges mother is a papist Christian, and the king hym selfe and all

<p>Our whole Manillia fleete of x seale, viz. 5 English and 5 Duch, are

<p>Since which tyme I have receved 2 letters from Mr. Fursland, the
precedent, dated in Jaccatra the 26th of March and 25th of August last
past, wherein he and his councell advized me and the rest of the
merchantes in the factory to leave affe our consortshipp of the fleet
of defence with the Hollanders, and to send our 5 shipps for Jaccatra
with as much speed as conveniently we could; and that the <i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i>

Osterwick,
with one man for a second, and a therd for an assistant, as should be
thought fitting; and that my selfe, Mr. Wm. Eaton, and Edmond Sayer
should com alonge in the said shipps for Jaccatra, for lessenyng
charges in the factory. Which directions, God willing, shall be
followed soe neare as we can.</p>

<p>The Hollanders this yeare sent a new fleet of shipps of 14 or 15
seale, greate and small, to have taken Amacan; but they had the
repulse with the losse, as som say, of 300, and others say 500 men,
and 4 of their shipps burned; the king of China now permitting the
Portingales to fortefie Amacon, which he would never condecend unto
till now, and hath geven order to the vizroy of Canton to assist them
with 100,000 men against the Hollanders, yf need require. There was 4
of our 10 shipps of the fleete of defence, 2 English and 2 Hollanders,
plying up and downe before Amacon before the Hollandes fleete of 15
seale arived there. The English shipps were the <i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i> and
the <i class="shipname">Bull</i>, whoe, in passing by, hailed them with a noes of trumpetes, but
the Dutch made them noe answer nether by word of mouth nor otherwaies,
but passed in by them with silence; which at first made them stand in
dowbt whether they were frendes or noe. But the Hollanders made
accompt to have taken the towne at first onset without the helpe of
our shiping or men, and therefore vouchsafed not to speake to them;
yet fayled of their purpose, but since have fortefied them selves in
an iland neare to Isla Fermosa called Isla de Piscadores, where they
report is a very good harbour and water enough for the greatest shipps
in the worlde.</p>

<p>The Hollanders have geven it out to the Chinas that they are
Englishmen, only to bring our nation in disgrace; of the which our
China frendes in Japon have adviz and have retorned answer per 2 or 3
severall conveances to the contrary, and that we had two English
shipps before Amacon, when the Hollanders gave the attempt against the
place,
<!--337.png--><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 333]</span>
but went for Japon without assisting them at all. And the
Hollanders in Japon doe geve it out heare that we are halves with them
in the new fortification of Piscadores, of the which our precedent
writeth me to the contrary. I am afeard that their attempt against
Amacon will cause both them and us to be driven out of Japon, for it
hath overthrowne the China trade in these partes. Yet our China
frendes still tell us we may have trade into China, yf we will, it
being granted allready; but by meanes of the warrs of the Tartar
against them and the death of 3 kinges of China in one or 2 yeares is
the cause we have not entred before now; but, for the Hollanders, he
will never suffer them to enter upon any conditions whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. Osterwick and my selfe, with 2 of the cheefe of the Hollandes
factory, were at Edo after the departure of our shipps the last yeare,
with presentes for themperour and his councell, hoping to have gott
lycense to have carid out men and munition as in tyme past, but could
get nothing but feare wordes for the space of 3 months we were forced
to stay at Edo before we could gett our dispach, they telling us in
the end they could conclude nothing untill the arivall of the King of
Firando, whome they had sent for, but at his coming they would take
such order about that which we demanded, as also about the delivering
the friggates goods, as should be to both our contentes. And, as we
retorned, we mett the King of Firando in the way, whoe made us many
faire promisses. Yet now order is com from Edo that themperour will
have all the priz goodes of the friggat for hym selfe, leving the
rotten hull for us and the Hollanders, and, although we have made what
resistance we could, yet are we constrayned to deliver it to them,
will we or nill we; and, that which is more, they constrayne us to way
over all the goodes to them, we being enformed they will make plito
against us for much more matters then ever we receved and beleeve the
lying reportes of our
<!--338.png--><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 334]</span>
enemies whoe duble all. And for carying out
men and munition as in tyme past, that such a mighty prince as
themperour of Japon is, having once passed his word to the contrary,
would not alter it now at the demand of such people as we are. And
this is the best we can find now in Japon, and I dowbt wilbe every day
worse then other.</p>

<p>The 2 fryres or semenary pristes which came in the friggat from
Manillia are both rosted to death at Nangasaque, with Yoshen Dies,
capt. of the friggat, whoe was a Japon, put to death with the frires
Spaniardes; and 12 other Japons which were marrenars in the friggat
were beheaded in their sight, before the other 3 were executed. As
alsoe, since that tyme, above xij other Spanish and Portingall fryres
and Jesuistes have byn rosted to death at Nangasaque, and above a
hundred Japons put to death by fire and sword, both men, woamen, and
children, for entertayning and harboring of them.</p>

<p>Also, now of late, a China junck arived at Shaxma in Japon, which came
from Caggalion, in the Manillias, and brought 4 Spaniardes or
Portingales in her for passingers, they telling the Chinas they were
merchantes, but are fownd to be pristes and sent presoners to
Nangasaque, where it is thought they shalbe rosted to death as the
former have byn, and the China marenars in danger all to lose their
lives, and the goodes seazed upon, which did all belong to Andrea
Dittis, the China Capt. (our frend), whoe is forced to send his sonne
to the court with great presentes to save his goodes, yf it be
possible.</p>

<p>The capt. more or major of the Portingall gallion or adventures which
com from Amacon to Nangasaque, called Jeronimo de Figeredo Caravallo,
with Lues Martin, Jorge Bastian, and Jarvasias Garçis, Portugezes, and
Harnando Ximenes, a Spaniard, whoe was <i>jurebasso</i> in tyms past at
Bantam, are brought in question for going about to steale a fryer or
padre from the Hollands howse the last yeare,
<!--339.png--><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 335]</span>
and, allthough the padre
was brought back (which was one of them which was rosted), yet are
they all empresoned and condemned and all their goodes confiscat, and
looke howrly when they shall be executed. And one of the Hollandes
<i>jurebassos</i> and a scrivano, being Japons, with the master of the bark
which carid hym away, his wife and children, all executed; this
Emperour, Shongo Samma, being such a mortall enemie to the name of a
Christian, espetially of papisticall Christians. And heretofore, when
I was at the court at Edo, the Emperours councell did aske me severall
tymes whether I were a Christian or our English nation soe; which I
tould hym yea; and, in the end, askinge me soe often, I tould them
they might perceve per the letters the Kinges Matie. of England sent
to themperour of Japon whether we were Christians or noe, the Kinges
Matie. writing hymselfe defender of the Christian faith. And then they
asked me whether there were any difference betwixt our religion and
the Spanish; unto which I answered yea, for that we held nothing of
the pope of Roome, but next and emediately under God from our kinge:
which it seemed in some sort to geve them content.</p>

<p>We and the Hollanders have had much a doe in standing out for not
delivring the priz goodes of the friggat, it belonging to our prince
and cuntrey, as taken from their enemies. But that would not serve,
the <i class="title">tono</i> or cheefe justis of Firando telling us that, yf we would
not leave it by feare meanes, they would take it whether we would or
noe, and that yf we had not absolutely proved the Portingalls to be
padres, that themperour ment to have put Capt. Leonard Camps and me to
death and to have sezed on all we had in the cuntrey, and, yf any
resistance had byn made, to have burned all our shiping and put us all
to the sword. God send us well out of Japon, for I dowbt it wilbe
every day worse then other.</p>

<p><!--340.png--><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 336]</span>
Yt is also said the Emperour will banish all Spaniardes and Portingall
howseholders out of Japon, and suffer non to stay but such as com and
goe in their shiping, to prevent entertayning of padres. And soe let
this suffice for the present state of Japon.</p>

<p class="right smaller">Firando in Japon, the 14th of November, 1622.</p>

<p>May it please your Wors. that the 9th of September last past there
departed 5 Hollandes shipps from hence, greate and small, 4 of them
for Isla de Piscadores with provition, and one directly for Jaccatra,
which was the <i class="shipname">Trow</i>. But, by means of extremety of wether, 4 of them
retorned back to Firando the 19th of September, viz. the <i class="shipname">Bantam</i>, the
<i class="shipname">Trow</i>, the <i class="shipname">Muoien</i>, the <i class="shipname">Tortola</i>: all in greate extremety, mastes
cutt overbord, and much provition throwne into the sea. And the other
penisse called the <i class="shipname">Santa Croix</i>, wherein were above 30 men, retorned
not back; soe they think she is cast away. As alsoe, in the same
storme, the Hollanders had other 2 shipps cast away in the roade of
Cochie at Firando, the one called the <i class="shipname">Moone</i>, a shipp of 7 or 800
tonns, and the other, the <i class="shipname">Hownd</i>, an English shipp in tymes past.</p>

<p>The xvijth of October the <i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i> and <i class="shipname">Pepercorne</i> put to sea on
their pretended voyages, as I formerly nomenated, and 2 Duch shipps,
the <i class="shipname">Trow</i> and the <i class="shipname">Harlam</i>, went out with them; and 3 other Holland
shipps went from hence after them the xxvjth ditto, viz. the <i class="shipname">Bantam</i>,

<i class="shipname">Tortolla</i>, to tuch all at Piscadores, to discharge
tymber and plankes which they carry to fortefie themselves.</p>

<p>The <i class="shipname">Moone</i> is now ready to put to sea to follow the <i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i> to
Jamby; and we dispach away the <i class="shipname">Bull</i> to goe in company with her; but
send nether money nor goodes in the <i class="shipname">Moone</i>, nether sent we any in the
<i class="shipname">Palsgrove</i>, the precedent Mr. Fursland comanding the contrary in his

And Edmond Sayer and Ric. Hudson are at this instant ready to departe

the Hollanders are the like, and our frendes geve us councell not to

<p>I know I need not to adviz of the unrulynesse of many of our marrenars

<p>The Hollanders have this yeare sould greate store of broad cloth,
stamettes, blacks, and other cullars, non being left to sell, and at
20 <i class="measure">tais</i> and some above per <i>tattamy</i>, and have written for more to
Jaccatra to be sent in the next shipp which cometh; as I have donne
the like to the precedent, yf any be there to send it. The reason of
venting broadcloth is the rumor of warrs very likely to have ensued in
Japon, and God knoweth what will com of it; for, since the writing of
my last, there is a greate conspirasie discoverd against the person of
the Emperour Shonga Samma by 8 or 9 of the greatest and powrfullest
princes in Japon, and is thought many others have a hand in it, and
his owne bretheren and nearest kinsmen amongst the rest, and the king
of this place not free. Soe that it is thought the
<!--343.png--><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 339]</span>
adverse partie is
soe stronge that themperour dare not meddell with them, but will wink
at the matter and make peace with them.</p>

<p>The Hollanders have sent greate store of monies and provition to their
fortefication at Piscadores, thinking to get trade with the Chinas by
one meanes or other; which I am perswaded will not fall out to their
exspectation, except they take the China junckes which trade to Isla
Fermosa, called by them Taccasanga, which is within sight of the
Piscadores. And the Emperour of Japon hath geven out his passe or
<i>goshon</i> to the Chinas to trade to Taccasanga, and soe from thence
into Japon; soe, yf they be medled withall, their is noe staying in
Japon for them which take them. For the 10th ultimo Edmond Sayer, with
Ric. Hudson and 2 Hollanders, went from hence towardes Edo with
presentes to themperour and his Councell; and we have adviz from them
of their arivall at Miaco, and that all men speake ill of them and cry
out against them. Soe God knoweth whether our presentes will be
receved or noe; but we deliver ours apart and doe mentayne we have
nothing to doe with them in their plantation at Piscadores. Of which I
thought good to adviz your Wors.</p>

<p>Silk at present is not worth soe much as it was at the arivall of our
fleete, yet we have made away most of ours which rested, the presentes
being geven out, and trusted it out till the next monson; as the
Hollanders have donne the like.</p>

<p>And our frend Andrea Dittis, the China Capt., still mentayneth that
our nation may have trade into China, yf they will, but not the
Hollanders; which God grant may once take effect.</p>

<p>I have not what else to adviz your Wors. of, matters standing as they
doe; but hope the next monson to com towardes England, God sparinge me
liffe and health, and

<p class="p2">Mr. Cox and the rest,&mdash;</p>

<p>By the <i class="shipname">Palsgrave</i> and the rest of our shipps of defence, contrary
to our expectacon and expresse comission, instead of your personall
appeerance in this place, wee have received severall letters from your
selfe and the rest, which gives us no satisfaccion for the breach of
our comission, neither is therein conteyned any reason of validitie to
excuse your so greate disobediance. What mooved you hereunto wee knowe
not, but so many yeres should have had so much experience as to knowe
what it is to infringe his superiors comition, and certaine wee are
that you cannot answere this your transgretion, if wee should call you
and the rest soe stricktly to accompt as your neglect deserveth. But
wee will suppose that those your proceedinges were more through
ignorance then out of any setled purpose of contempt towardes us, and
will forbeare to censure you at present, in hoape of your conformetie
now at last to our second comission, which wee send heerewith by our
loving frend Mr. Joseph Cockram, whome wee have and doe appointe
cheefe marchant of the
<!--345.png--><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 341]</span>
<i class="shipname">Bull</i> for the whole voyage. Which shipp wee
have nowe made reddy, with no small charge to our employers, purposely
to send her unto you, to bring awaye boath your selfe and the rest of
the factors, with all the Compa. estate remayning there in the
countrie, as more particulerly wee have declared in our comission to
Mr. Cockram and instructions delivered to him; heereby straightly
charging and comanding, in behalfe of the Honble. Companie our
masters, that, uppon sight heereof, you, Mr. Richard Cock, shall
deliver over into the handes and custody of Mr. Joseph Cockram all
such monnies, goods, debts, etc., as pertaine to the Honnorable
Compa., our imployers; and boath you, Mr. Richard Cock, Wm. Eaton,
Edmond Sayre, and John Osterwick, shall all and every of you come
awaye from thence uppon the shipp <i class="shipname">Bull</i> for Batavia; hereby charging
you and every of you to fulfill our saide order, as you will answere
the contrary at your perelles.</p>

<p>The debts which were standing out by your last letters we hope you
will have cleired and received them in before this shall come to your
hands, knowing the last yere that you are to come from thence. But, if
any such debts shalbe yett standing out, it concernes you that made
them [to receive them] in before the shipp come awaye from thence. The
China Nocheda hath two long deluded you through your owne simplicitie
to give creditt unto him. You have lived long enough in those parts to
be better experienced of the fraudulent practizes of those people,
and, although the prejudice which the Honnorable Compa. have suffered
by missing of such greate somes of monney so long, which you have
delivered unto him, cannot be recompenced by him, yet it will now be
respected and required that you procure all satisfaccon from him for
all he owes unto the Compa. The King of Firando his debt wee hoape you
have received, boath all somes of such moment as it behooves you to be
carefull and
<!--346.png--><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 342]</span>
dilligent in the recovering in of them; and, in hoape
you will herein sattisfie our expectacon, wee desist further to incite
you in this matter.</p>

<p>Having cleered all busines and gotten the Companies estate aboard
their shipp, which wee desire may be with all speede convenient, you
are to take frendly leave of the king and such other officers as you
knowe to be meete, and to deliver over the Compa. howse and godownes
into the kings hands, to appoint some whome hee shall thincke fitting
to keepe the same for the Honnorable Compas. use, untill such tyme as
wee shall send theither againe to repossesse the same. And for all
such provitions as wee have given order unto Mr. Cockram to provide
for this place, you are to see them furnished in due tyme, that soe
the shipp may take the best season of the monsonn to come awaye from
thence.</p>

<p>Alsoe you are to furnish the shipp with all materialls needefull for
her tryming, and eache thinge according to our order given for the
perforemance of the busines, and lett the flesh that is to be provided
be salted in such a tyme as it may keepe to doe us service. If the
full quantetie cannot be provided in dew tyme, then furnish what you
cann, for wee will that no busines shall hinder the shipps and your
coming awaye from thence in dew tyme to performe her voyage unto this
port of Batavia.</p>

<p>And in case there shall be any debts of vallue standing out which
cannot be recovered before your lymitted tyme of coming from thence,
and that there be certaine hopes to recover in the saide debts
afterward, then you shall followe such order as wee have given Mr.
Cockram for the leaving of a mann there to recover such debts as
shalbe remayning and cannot be gotten in as aforesaid.</p>

<p>The China menn which you sent to refine the silver returne in this
shipp. They have refined only one chist of barr plate for triall, and
that wee finde so badly donn
<!--347.png--><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 343]</span>
that we would not lett them proceede
any further. They are not suffitient to performe what they have
undertaken, for they spoile all they take in hand; so that what you
have agreed with them for is meerely cast awaye and lost to the
Honnorable Compa. Wee have payde them no wages heere, which you are to
take notice of and reccon with them there according as you can agree
with them.</p>

<p>Wee desire no more barr plate; wherefore the rest remayning, lett it
be in <i>soma</i>, <i>seda</i>, and <i>fabuck</i> plate. But, if there be any such
dannger in bringing out the latter, wee desire not to stand to such an
adventure. The Dutch have greate quantities sent, yet make no such
dannger as you write of; wherefore, if you cannot gett it as securely
as they, wee must take such as may be procured without such hassarde.</p>

<p>Camphire which the Hollanders buy in such quanteties wee knowe no vend
for; yett you may provide twenty cases or tenn <i>peculs</i>, which
may serve for a triall both for England and Mu[su]l[i]pa[tam]; but any
greater quantitie then prementioned send not.</p>

<p>In this shipp we have laden a small parcell of camphire of Barouse,
being in all 60 <i>catts</i>. If the quantetie be over greate, you may
keepe it secrett and receive it ashore by small parcells, as you can
sell it. Wee would have sent more if wee had byn ascertined of its
vend there; but, acording to your former advices, this nowe sent may
be too much. What part of it you cannot sell bring back with you, or
leave it there with him that stays in the factory, if there be
occasion to leave a man there; the ordering whereof, with all other
busines, wee have referred to Mr. Cockram, as aforesaide.</p>

<p>We expect to have a reformacion in the lavish expences for the shipps
companie. It is the Honnorable Compa. expresse order that in any port,
where refreshing may be had good cheape, they shall not have allowance
of above
<!--348.png--><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 344]</span>
foure flesh meales a weeke and three meales with salt fish
or such like to eate with their rice. This order you are to take
notice of and to perfoarme the same; neither may you feede the saylors
both aboard and ashore, which (as wee are informed) hath byn a common
costom with you, to the excescive charg of the Honnorable Companie,
our masters.</p>

<p>You write the pursers aught not to be allowed the foure per cento
which they bring to accompt for losse in monneys, and referr it to us
to abate it. This abatement you ought to have made there, knowing it
to be unreasonable, and should not send such matters unto us to decide
where the pursers want no excuses for themselfes, and wee cannot
contradict them but only with your barr (wee cannot see you [how ?]
they can loose so much), which is no suffitient reason. Wherefore with
this purser of the <i class="shipname">Bull</i> now better examine that busines, and,
finding it an abuse by the pursers, abate it uppon Mr. Watts accompt;
and, at your arivall heere, wee will take the like course with the
rest or so many of them as are heere remayning.</p>

<p>And because the last yere, to serve your owne turne, you made what
construction you pleased of our comission for your coming from thence,
wee doe nowe iterate our comission in the conclusion of our letter,
least, having redd itt in the former part thereof, you should forgett
it before you come to thend. Wee will and comaund in the name and
behalfe of the Honnorable Compa. of Marchants of London trading [to]
East India, our masters, that you, Mr. Richard Cock, William Eaton,
Edmond Sayre, and John Osterwick, shall deliver over into the hands of
Mr. Joseph Cockram all monneys, goods, and debts perteyning to the
Honnorable Compa. aforesayde, and shall all and every of you
aforenamed come away from Japon in the shipp <i class="shipname">Bull</i> for this port of
Battavia. Which our order wee require you to performe, as you will
answere the contrary at your perill. And soe, hoping of your
conformitie unto the premises,
<!--349.png--><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 345]</span>

<h4>Transcriber&rsquo;s Note:</h4>

<p>The author&rsquo;s spelling and hyphenation of words and names is
inconsistent, e.g. Adams/Adames. Lower case Roman numerals often end
with a &lsquo;j&rsquo; instead of an &lsquo;i.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially. In the diary, footnotes were
moved to the end of the entry for the date in which the anchor occurs.
In the Appendix, footnotes were moved to follow the piece of
correspondence in which the anchor occurs.</p>

<p>To accommodate display on narrow screens, where braces were used in
the book to group data horizontally across the page, the text was
formatted as indented lists instead. The entry on Febrary 13, <a href="#example">here</a>, is
a typical example.</p>

<p>Missing periods were added to ends of sentences, abbreviations, and
index entries; missing commas were added to a list entry and between
page numbers in the index. Use of italics was made consistent.</p>

<p>In the Index, links were added only to pages
within this volume.</p>
